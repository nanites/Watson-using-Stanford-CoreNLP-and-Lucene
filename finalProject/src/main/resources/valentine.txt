"My Funny Valentine" is a show tune from the 1937 Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart musical Babes in Arms in which it was introduced by former child star Mitzi Green. Recorded by Chet Baker, Frank Sinatra, Andy Williams, Miles Davis and Chaka Khan, the song is a popular jazz standard, appearing on over 1300 albums performed by over 600 artists.

==Structure==

The basic structure of the song on a c-minor tonic is as follows:
This simple and classic structure makes it easy to adapt to other genres and for jazz musicians to improvise over the established chords.

==History==

Babes in Arms opened at the Shubert Theatre on Broadway, in New York City on April 14, 1937 and ran for 289 performances.[tpl]cite book |last=Trager |first=James |year=2005 |title=The People's Chronology: A Year-by-Year Record of Human Events from Prehistory to the Present |edition=3 |location=Detroit |publisher=Gale |isbn=0805031340[/tpl]  In the original play, a character named Billie Smith (played by Mitzi Green) sings the song to Valentine "Val" LaMar (played by Ray Heatherton).Playbill from 1937 Babes in Arms theatrical performance  In the song, Billie pokes fun at some of Valentine's characteristics, but ultimately affirms that he makes her smile and that she doesn't want him to change.

[[Anti-psychologism]]

CATEGORIES: Theories of deduction

In logic, anti-psychologism is a theory about the nature of logical truth, that it does not depend upon the contents of human ideas but exists independent of human ideas.  The term was coined by Gottlob Frege (the most famous anti-psychologist of Logic), and has been the centre of an important debate in analytical philosophy, closely related to the internalism and externalism debate in logic and epistemology.
The rival thesis, psychologism, is not widely held amongst logicians, but it does have some high-profile defenders, for example Dov Gabbay.
Edmund Husserl was an important proponent of anti-psychologism, and this trait passed on to other phenomenologists, such as Martin Heidegger, whose doctoral thesis was meant to be a refutation of psychologism. They shared the argument that, because the proposition "no-p is a not-p" is not logically equivalent to "It is thought that 'no-p is a not-p'", psychologism does not logically stand. Psychologism was criticized in logic also by Charles Sanders PeircePeirce attacked the idea, held by some logicians at that time, that rationality rests on a feeling of logicality, rather than on fact. See the first of Peirce's 1903 Lowell Institute Lectures "What Makes a Reasoning Sound?", Essential Peirce v. 2, pp. 242-257. See also the portion of Peirce's 1902 Minute Logic published in Collected Papers v. 2 (1931), paragraphs 18–19 and 39–43. Peirce held that mathematical and philosophical logics precede psychology as a special science and that they do not depend on it for principles. whose fields included logic, philosophy, and experimental psychology,Peirce (sometimes with Joseph Jastrow) investigated the probability judgments of experimental subjects, pioneering decision analysis. He and Jastrow wrote "On Small Differences in Sensation", Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences (1885), 3, 73-83, presented 17 October 1884, reprinted in Collected Papers v. 7, paragraphs 21–35.

[[1,1'-Bi-2-naphthol]]

CATEGORIES: 2-Naphthols

1,1'-Bi-2-naphthol (BINOL) is an organic compound that is often used as a ligand for transition-metal catalysed asymmetric synthesis. BINOL has axial chirality and the two enantiomers can be readily separated and are stable toward racemisation.  The specific rotation of the two enantiomers is +/- 35.5° (c=1 in THF). BINOL is a precursor for another chiral ligand called BINAP.

==Preparation==

The organic synthesis of BINOL is not a challenge as such but the preparation of the individual enantiomers is.
(S)-BINOL can be prepared directly from an asymmetric oxidative coupling of 2-naphthol with copper(II) chloride. The chiral ligand in this reaction is (S)-(+)-amphetamine.
Racemic BINOL can also be produced using iron(III) chloride as an oxidant. The mechanism involves complexation of iron(III) into the hydroxyl, followed by a radical coupling reaction of the naphthol rings initiated by iron(III) reducing into iron(II).
Optically active BINOL can also be obtained from racemic BINOL by optical resolution. In one method, the alkaloid N-benzylcinchonidinium chloride form a crystalline inclusion compound.  The inclusion compound of the S-enantiomer is soluble in acetonitrile but that of the R-enantiomer is not."RESOLUTION OF  1,1'-BI-2-NAPHTHOL", Dongwei Cai, David L. Hughes, Thomas R. Verhoeven, and Paul J. Reider, in Organic Syntheses Coll. Vol. 10, p.93; Vol. 76, p.1
In another method BINOL is reacted with the acid chloride pentanoyl chloride to obtain the di-ester compound. The enzyme cholesterol esterase is then added in the form of bovine pancreas acetone powder which is able to hydrolyse the (S)-di-ester but not the (R)-di-ester. The (R)-dipentanoate is hydrolysed in a second step with sodium methoxide."(S)-(−)- AND (R)-(+)-1,1'-BI-2-NAPHTHOL", Romas J. Kazlauskas in Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 9, p.77; Vol. 70, p.60
Third method employs HPLC with chiral stationary phases.

==BINOL compounds==

Many variations of BINOL exist, BINAP being one of them.
The compound AlLibis(binaphthoxide) (ALB) is prepared by reaction of BINOL with lithium aluminium hydride.A practical large-scale synthesis of enantiomerically pure 3-bis(methoxycarbonyl)methylcyclohexanone via catalytic asymmetric Michael reaction Tetrahedron, Volume 58, Issue 13, 25 March 2002, Pages 2585–2588 Youjun Xu, Ken Ohori, Takashi Ohshima, Masakatsu Shibasaki [tpl]DOI|10.1016/S0040-4020(02)00141-2[/tpl]

[[OzWin]]

CATEGORIES: Windows Internet software, CompuServe

OzWin was a client program which was used to connect to the CompuServe Information Service. It was a GUI program written in Delphi that ran on the Microsoft Windows operating system. It was published by Ozarks West Software Inc. and programmed by Steve Sneed. 
OzWin was born out of the earlier OzCIS program which was DOS based. OzWin allowed users to connect to CompuServe forums and batch download messages, files, and so forth from the server and then disconnect. They could then read the messages offline, and as well compose new messages and replies while offline. When they finished reading and composing messages, they could connect again to batch send all of the messages, as well as receive any new messages others had posted to the forums. This allowed users to batch upload and download messages and then work offline, minimising the time they were connected to CompuServe. This was important, since at that time, users were charged by the hour to connect to CompuServe, so remaining connected all the time was an expensive proposition and could quickly run up charges.
Like OzCIS, OzWin also had features for up- and downloading files to the forum libraries, plus a complete set of SysOp features such as moving and deleting messages, administering the file libraries, and "flagging" users (giving/denying SysOp rights, kicking/banning). 
Unlike other offline readers such as TapCIS and NavCIS which added proprietary ways of formatting text (colors, fonts, attributes), OzWin always remained "plain text" and never displayed any custom styles.

[[Beauveria bassiana]]

CATEGORIES: Biopesticides, Hypocreales, Malaria, Parasitic fungi

Beauveria bassiana is a fungus that grows naturally in soils throughout the world and acts as a parasite on various arthropod species, causing white muscardine disease; it thus belongs to the entomopathogenic fungi. It is being used as a biological insecticide to control a number of pests such as termites, thrips, whiteflies, aphids and different beetles. Its use in the control of bedbugs and malaria-transmitting mosquitos is under investigation.Donald G. McNeil Jr., Fungus Fatal to Mosquito May Aid Global War on Malaria, The New York Times, 10 June 2005

==Discovery and name==

The species is named after the Italian entomologist Agostino Bassi, who discovered it in 1835 as the cause of the muscardine disease of domesticated silkworms. It was formerly also known as Tritirachium shiotae.  The name B. bassiana has long been used to describe a species complex of morphologically similar and closely related isolates. Rehner and Buckley [tpl]cite journal|author=Rehner SA, Buckley E |journal=Mycologia |year=2005  |title=A Beauveria phylogeny inferred from nuclear ITS and EF1-{alpha} sequences: evidence for cryptic diversification and links to Cordyceps teleomorphs |volume=97 |pages=84–98 |pmid=16389960 |issue=1 |doi=10.3852/mycologia.97.1.84[/tpl] have shown that B. bassiana consists of many distinct lineages that should be recognized as distinct phylogenetic species and the genus Beauveria was redescribed with a proposed type for B. bassiana in 2011.Stephen A. Rehner, Andrew M. Minnis, Gi-Ho Sung, J. Jennifer Luangsaard, Luis Devotto, and Richard A. Humber (2011) Phylogeny and systematics of the anamorphic, entomopathogenic genus Beauveria. Mycologia 103: 1055-1073  In light of this work and the known existence of cryptic species, it is important to characterise isolates used to develop biological insecticides.

===Relation to Cordyceps and other fungi===

Beauveria bassiana is the anamorph (asexually reproducing form) of Cordyceps bassiana. The latter teleomorph (the sexually reproducing form) has been collected only in eastern Asia.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF03187215|author=Li ZZ, Li CR, Huang B, Fan MZ |journal=Chinese Science Bulletin |year=2001 |title=Discovery and demonstration of the teleomorph of Beauveria bassiana (Bals.) Vuill., an important entomogenous fungus |volume=46|issue=9 |pages=751–3[/tpl]

===White muscardine disease===

The insect disease caused by the fungus is a muscardine which has been called white muscardine disease. When the microscopic spores of the fungus come into contact with the body of an insect host, they germinate, penetrate the cuticle, and grow inside, killing the insect within a matter of days. Afterwards, a white mold emerges from the cadaver and produces new spores. A typical isolate of B. bassiana can attack a broad range of insects; various isolates differ in their host range. The factors responsible for host susceptibility are not known.
Beauveria bassiana parasitizing the Colorado potato beetle has been reported to be, in turn, the host of a mycoparasitic fungus Syspastospora parasitica.[tpl]cite journal |author=Posada, F., et al. |title=Syspastospora parasitica, a mycoparasite of the fungus Beauveria bassiana attacking the Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata: a tritrophic association |journal=J. Insect Sci. |volume=4 |page=24 |year=2004 |pmid=15861239 |pmc=528884 [/tpl] This organism also attacks related insect-pathogenic species of the Clavicipitaceae.

==Morphology of the fungus==

In culture, B. bassiana grows as a white mould. On most common cultural media, it produces many dry, powdery conidia in distinctive white spore balls. Each spore ball is composed of a cluster of conidiogenous cells.  The conidiogenous cells of B. bassiana are short and ovoid, and terminate in a narrow apical extension called a rachis.  The rachis elongates after each conidium is produced, resulting in a long zig-zag extension. The conidia are single-celled, haploid, and hydrophobic.

==Use in biological control of insects==

Beauveria bassiana can be used as a biological insecticide to control a number of pests such as termites, whiteflies, and many other insects. Its use in the control of malaria-transmitting mosquitos is under investigation. As an insecticide, the spores are sprayed on affected crops as an emulsified suspension or wettable powder or applied to mosquito nets as a mosquito control agent.
As a (super?-) species, Beauveria bassiana parasitizes a very wide range of arthropod hosts. However, different strains vary in their host ranges, some having rather narrow ranges, like strain Bba 5653 that is very virulent to the larvae of the Diamondback Moth and kills only few other types of caterpillars. Some strains do have a wide host range and should therefore be considered nonselective biological insecticides. These should not be applied to flowers visited by pollinating insects.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/biopesticides/ingredients/factsheets/factsheet_128924.htm|title=EPA Factsheet|accessdate=2006-12-14[/tpl]

The fungus rarely infects humans or other animals, so it is generally considered safe as an insecticide.

[[God's Wife of Amun]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Egyptian titles, Ancient Egyptian priestesses

God's Wife of Amun (Egyptian: [tpl]unicode|ḥm.t nṯr n ỉmn[/tpl]) was the highest-ranking priestess of the Amun cult, an important Ancient Egyptian religious institution centered in Thebes during the Egyptian 25th and 26th dynasties (circa 740-525 BC). The office had political importance as well as religious, since the two were closely related in Ancient Egypt. 
Although the title is first attested in the Middle Kingdom, its full political potential was not realized until the advent of Egypt's 18th dynasty.

==History of the office==

 
 nTr-N41:X1 

The title of God's Wife of Amun first appears during the Tenth and Twelfth dynasties, when the title and position was held by non-royal women among those serving Min, Amun, and Ptah as priestesses. As the cult rose in importance among the other cults, stronger ties to the rulers became more necessary.

===Rise and fall in the eighteenth dynasty===

At the beginning of the New Kingdom the title started to be held by royal women (usually the wife of the king, but sometimes by the mother of the king), when its extreme power and prestige was first evident. The New Kingdom began in 1550 BC with the eighteenth dynasty. These were the rulers who drove the Hyksos out of Egypt and their native city was Thebes, which then became the leading city in Egypt. They believed that their local deity, Amun, had guided them in their victory and the cult rose to national importance. Adjustments to the rituals and myths followed.
The title, God's Wife of Amun, "referred to the myth of the divine birth of the king, according to which his mother was impregnated by the god Amun."Toby Wilkinson, The Thames and Hudson Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, Thames & Hudson, 2005. p.93 While the office theoretically, was sacred, it was essentially wielded as a political tool by the serving Egyptian pharaoh to ensure "royal authority over the Theban region and the powerful priesthood of Amun" there.Wilkinson, p.93 The royal lineage was traced through its women and, the rulers and the religious institutions were inexorably woven together in traditions that remained quite stable over a period of three thousand years. This title was used in preference to the title, Great Royal Wife, which was the title of the queen who was the consort to the pharaoh and who officiated at the temple. The new title conveyed that the pharaoh would be a demigod upon birth. Previously the pharaoh was considered to become divine only at death. 
The first royal wife to hold this new title (not to be mistaken with the title of God's Wife) was Queen Ahmose-Nefertari, the wife of Ahmose I, and this event is recorded in a stela in the temple of Amun at Karnak, and the role was a priestly post of importance in the temple of Amun in Thebes. She then passed it on to her daughter Meritamen, who in turn handed it to Hatshepsut, who used it before she ascended the throne as pharaoh. 
Both Ahmose-Nefertari and Hatshepsut sometimes used the title as an alternative to that of "King's Principal Wife", which shows how important they felt the role was. Hatshepsut passed the title on to her daughter Neferure. 
A series of scenes in Hatshepsut's Chapelle Rouge show the God's Wife of Amun (her daughter) and a male priest undergoing a ritual or ceremony that seems to be aimed at destroying the names of enemies. Other scenes elsewhere show the God's Wife of Amun worshiping the deities, being purified in the sacred lake, and following the king into the sanctuary. These again show the importance of the role, but give very little indication of the tasks and responsibilities involved.
Hatshepsut was the daughter of Thutmose I and, upon his death, she became the wife of the youthful Thutmose II who was her young half-brother, born to a lesser wife than her mother. She seems to have been a de facto co-regent with him, having a great deal of influence upon the affairs of state. They had only one child who survived childhood, a daughter, Neferure, to whom the title of God's Wife of Amun was passed. 
Upon the death of her husband Thutmose II, Hatshepsut was appointed regent for the very youthful Thutmose III, who was not born to her—the royal wife and queen of his father—rather, he was born of a lesser wife. He was her stepson and cousin. Shortly thereafter, Hatshepsut was named pharaoh. 
Her daughter, Neferure, took her place in many functions that required a royal queen serving as the Great Royal Wife and, as God's Wife of Amun in the temple, while Thutmose III remained as co-regent to Hatshepsut. He became the head of the armies.
Hatshepsut died after a 22-year reign and, Thutmose III became pharaoh. At the end of a thirty year reign of his own, he entered into a co-regency with a son by a lesser wife who would become, Amenhotep II. Neferure had died without leaving another heir, but there were others in line to become pharaoh,[tpl]who?|date=December 2012[/tpl] so the co-regency assured that these royal offspring with closer ties to Hatshepsut would be removed from the line of descent, and Thutmose III's chosen heir would rule. 
The records of holders of the title, God's Wife of Amun, after Thutmose III became pharaoh deviate from the established pattern, perhaps because of the line of royalty issue. After Neferure the list notes, Iset, the mother of Tuthmosis III, but it is quite certain that she never officiated, and was awarded the title after her death. Next is, Satiah, a lesser wife of Tuthmosis III in the early part of his reign. She is followed by, Merytre-Hatshepsut, another lesser wife of Tuthmosis III, who became the mother of his ultimate heir. She was the daughter of the Divine Adoratrice of Amun, Huy. Next on the list is, Meritamen, a daughter of Tuthmosis III and Merytre-Hatshepsut, thereby the sister of his ultimate heir. After all of those changes during his long reign, the office holder was the daughter of Thutmose III, returning to the traditional association. 
Amenhotep II seems to be the one who initiated the attempts to remove records of Hatshepsut's reign while his father was an old man and continued these efforts after he became pharaoh in his own right, claiming many of her achievements as his own, but failing to be thorough.   
Amenhotep II also tried to break traditions by preventing the names of his wives from being recorded and introducing women who were not from the royal lineage into the line of descent—without success—as his designated heir was overlooked. After his death, which is estimated as 1400 BC, Tuthmosis IV was selected from the royal lineage as the next pharaoh.
The power and prestige of the role of the God's Wife of Amun was greatly diminished by Amenhotep II. He may have declined to have one, unless it remained as his sister, Meritamen. The woman listed as holding the office next is, Tiaa. That is the name of a wife of his who was the mother of Tuthmosis IV and it is possible that she was named to this title by her son since he gave her other titles, however, the daughter of Tuthmosis IV also was named, Tiaa. 
Later in that dynasty, with religious changes affecting the status of the cult, the title then fell out of favour. The pharaoh Amenhotep IV ruling from 1353 or 1351 initially followed the religious traditions. Soon he instituted a new religion that elevated Aten, not only to become the dominant cult, but as a monotheistic cult, suppressing the worship of others. The pharaoh changed his name to Akhenaten and moved his court to a new capital he had built, Akhetaten Horizon of Aten, at the site known today as Amarna. He and his royal wife, Nefertiti (whom he treated as a co-regent) became the intermediaries between Aten and the people. The worship of Amun was especially targeted for suppression and many of his temples were defaced and no idols were permitted. Aten became The Aten, represented only as a solar disk. Religious rituals were performed in open air settings. 
The death of Akhenaten occurred circa 1336 BC and it was not long before the traditional religious practices began to resume. It is possible that Nefertiti ruled under another name and, perhaps, was an influence in the royal family until near the end of the rule of Tutankhamun (1333-1324 BC), but if she did, she did not prevent the revival.
Tutankhamun began ruling as a child of nine under the name of Tutankhaten. Some think that he was the son of Akhenaten by a minor wife. During his reign his name was changed away from the deity of his father, replacing aten with amun. This marks the beginning of a transition back to Thebes as the capital as well. 
The last ruler of the eighteenth dynasty, Horemheb (1320-1292 BC), restored the priesthood of Amun, but he prevented the Amun priesthood from resuming the powerful position they had held before Akhenaten dissolved the powerful cult and moved the capital away from their city. Horemheb had reformed the army and had developed a loyal chain of command within it. By appointing priests to the cult of Amun from the high ranks of his trusted army, he avoided any attempts to reestablish the powerful relationships that had provoked the drastic change made by Akhenaten.

===Revival during dynasty twenty through twenty-six===

The title, God's Wife of Amun, was revived during the twentieth dynasty, when Ramesses VI (1145-1137 BC) conferred this office as well as the additional title of Divine Adoratrice of Amun on his daughter, Aset; the king's actions inaugurated the tradition where every subsequent holder of this office had to be, 
The office of the God's Wife of Amun reached the very heights of its political power during the late Third Intermediate Period of Egypt when Shepenupet I, Osorkon III's daughter, was first appointed to this post at Thebes. The Nubian king Kashta, in turn, appointed his daughter, Amenirdis, as her successor. The high status of this office is illustrated by the tomb of Amenirdis at Medinet Habu.Wilkinson, p.93
Later during the twenty-sixth dynasty, the Saite king Psamtik I would forcibly reunite Egypt in March 656 BC under his rule and compel the God's Wife of Amun serving at the time, Shepenupet II, daughter of Piye, to adopt his daughter Nitocris as her chosen successor to this position.
The office continued in existence until 525 BC under Nitocris' successor, Ankhnesneferibre, when the Persians overthrew Egypt's last Saite ruler, Psamtik III (526–525 BC), and enslaved his daughter. 
Thereafter, the powerful office of God's Wife of Amun disappears from history.

==Royal women holding the office of God's Wife of Amun==

Holders of the office from the tenth through the twelfth dynasties are not noted on this list because they were not women from the royal line.
(hiatus - when the title was not used, due to political and religious changes that occurred and reverted again)

[[Bob Schneider]]

CATEGORIES: Living people, 1965 births, People from Munich, Musicians from Austin, Texas, People from Ypsilanti, Michigan, University of Texas at El Paso alumni

Bob Schneider (born October 12, 1965) is an Austin, Texas–based musician and artist. He currently resides in Bee Cave, Texas.

==Early career==

Bob was born in Ypsilanti, Michigan, and raised in Munich, Germany. The son of an opera singer, he moved with his parents to Germany when he was two.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid:523605 |title=photograph by Todd V. Wolfson: Bob Schneider Austin Music |publisher=AustinChronicle.com |date= |accessdate=January 2, 2011[/tpl] He learned guitar and piano at an early age and made his first live appearances performing at his parents' parties.
He performed for years in various bands before embarking on a solo career. He dropped out of the University of Texas at El Paso where he studied art to front his first band, the funk-and-rap outfit Joe Rockhead. The band independently released three albums before disbanding immediately prior to signing with a major label.
A stint with a jamming outfit called the Ugly Americans followed, which experienced some success as an opening act for the Dave Matthews Band and H.O.R.D.E. festival.
In 1997, Schneider went on to co-found The Scabs, which later merged with the Ugly Americans. With The Scabs, Bob Schneider made a further name for himself as the front man.
None of these bands gained much national recognition, but built solid reputations on the road. They were also a fixture in the Austin live music culture.

==Solo career==

In 1999, Schneider became a solo act, though performing at first under the band name Lonelyland (which he later dropped as a band name, but titled his first major-label album after). Schneider's musical approach as a solo artist has proven as eclectic as the diverse musical styles of his former bands: a little bit singer/songwriter, a whole lot of bits and pieces of funk, country, rock, and folk. Because of the sexual nature of some of his lyrics, Schneider's music has been labeled as "adult alternative" by some.
He went on to record the major-label solo albums Lonelyland (2001) and I'm Good Now (2004), which garnered him significantly more national attention and some critical acclaim.  "Big Blue Sea" from the Lonelyland album received significant radio play, as did "Come With Me Tonight" from I'm Good Now. "Metal & Steel" from Lonelyland is, to date, Bob's most played song.http://www.mediabase.com
His contract with his labels (signed with Universal in 2001, and then with Vanguard in 2004) allowed him to release albums as "side projects" on his own label Shockorama Records. Among the albums that have been self-released are Galaxy Kings and I've Seen The End of the World and It Looks Like This. All of these side projects were re-released by Vanguard corresponding with the release of his 2006 album The Californian. Previously, these albums were of limited availability and only roughly 10,000 of the albums were printed. After releasing The Californian, he released Greatest Hits Live, recorded in Austin on July 17, 2006, on Shockorama Records, which was only available through his website.
Bob remains committed to playing smaller venues and thrives on the energy of the stage. He currently has a long-standing Monday night residency at the Saxon Pub, and plays the legendary Antone's in Austin, Texas, with both his band and, on occasion, the Scabs, all while maintaining a tireless touring schedule. Although he tours nationwide, he is still known best as a true Austin musician. His musical influences spread into the far reaches of musical culture—funk, soul, folk, lounge, rap, punk, even some melodic experimentalism.
He is also known for having dated Sandra Bullock.  It is speculated that the breakup following their relationship became fodder for his music, although Schneider has been known to deny autobiographical content in his music.

==Kirtland Records==

In 2009, Bob signed with Kirtland Records to release his critically praised album Lovely Creatures, released September 29, 2009.  Lovely Creatures features the single "40 Dogs (Like Romeo and Juliet)", which has received significant national radio play – peaking at #14 on the AAA Radio Chart.http://www.mediabase.com The album and also features Patty Griffin on the track "Changing Your Mind."  Bob released a second album under the label entitled "A Perfect Day" on April 19, 2011, featuring the single "Let The Light In."
Following a series of website redesigns, his next album "Burden of Proof" was officially announced in December 2012 for an April, then May, and finally June 11 release in 2013.

[[Chiral ligand]]

CATEGORIES: Stereochemistry, Organometallic chemistry

In chemistry a chiral ligand is a specially adapted ligand used for asymmetric synthesis. This ligand is an enantiopure organic compound that combines with a metal center by chelation to form an asymmetric catalyst. This catalyst engages in a chemical reaction and transfers its chirality to the reaction product which as a result also becomes chiral. In an ideal reaction one equivalent of catalyst can turn over many more equivalents of reactant which enables the synthesis of a large amount of a chiral compound from achiral precursors with the aid of a very small (often expensive) chiral ligand.

==First discovery==

The first such ligand, the diphosphine DiPAMP was developed in 1968 by William S. Knowles of Monsanto Company, who won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry,Nobel prize 2001 www.nobelprize.org Link and ultimately used in the industrial production of L-DOPA.

==Privileged ligands==

Many thousands of chiral ligands have been prepared and tested since then but only several compound classes have been found to have a general scope. These ligands are therefore called privileged ligands.Design of chiral ligands for asymmetric catalysis: From C2-symmetric P,P- and N,N-ligands to sterically and electronically nonsymmetrical P,N-ligands Andreas Pfaltz and William J. Drury III PNAS, April 20, 2004 vol. 101 no. 16 5723-5726 [tpl]DOI|10.1073/pnas.0307152101[/tpl]Privileged Chiral Catalysts Tehshik P. Yoon, Eric N. Jacobsen Science 14 March 2003: Vol. 299. no. 5613, pp. 1691 - 1693 [tpl]DOI|10.1126/science.1083622[/tpl] PMID 12637734 Important members depicted below are BINOL, BINAP, TADDOL, DIOP, BOX and DuPhos (a phosphine ligand), all available as enantiomeric pairs.
Other members are Salen, cinchona alkaloids and phosphoramidites. Many of these ligands possess C2 symmetry which limits the number of possible reaction pathways and thereby increasing enantioselectivity.

==Chiral fence==

Chiral ligands work  asymmetric induction somewhere along the reaction coordinate. The image depicted on the right gives a general idea how a chiral ligand may induce an enantioselective reaction. The ligand (in green) has C2 symmetry with its nitrogen, oxygen or phosphorus atoms hugging a central metal atom (in red). In this particular ligand the right side is sticking out and its left side points away. The substrate in this reduction is acetophenone and the reagent (in blue) a hydride ion. In absence of the metal and the ligand the re face approach of the hydride ion gives the (S)-enantiomer and the si face approach the (R)-enantiomer in equal amounts (a racemic mixture like expected). The ligand/metal presence changes all that. The carbonyl group will coordinate with the metal and due to the steric bulk of the phenyl group it will only be able to do so with its si face exposed to the hydride ion with in the ideal situation exclusive formation of the (R) enantiomer. The re face will simply hit the chiral fence.Chiral and C2-symmetrical bis(oxazolinylpyridine)rhodium(III) complexes: effective catalysts for asymmetric hydrosilylation of ketones Hisao Nishiyama, Hisao Sakaguchi, Takashi Nakamura, Mihoko Horihata, Manabu Kondo, and Kenji Itoh Organometallics; 1989; 8(3) pp 846 - 848; [tpl]DOI| 10.1021/om00105a047[/tpl] Note that when the ligand is replaced by its mirror image the other enantiomer will form and that a racemic mixture of ligand will once again yield a racemic product. Also note that if the steric bulk of both carbonyl substituents is very similar the strategy will fail.

==Chiral counterions==

The San Juan  (Spanish: Río San Juan), also known as El Desaguadero ("the drain"), is a 192.06 km (119.7 mi) river that flows east out of Lake Nicaragua into the Caribbean Sea. A large section of the border between Nicaragua and Costa Rica runs on the right (southern) bank of the river. It was part, with the lake, of a proposed route for a Nicaragua Canal in the 19th century.

The Cañas–Jerez Treaty states that Nicaragua owns the waters of the river and that Costa Rica can only use it for commercial navigation on certain parts of the river at Nicaragua's discretion. 
Prior to the Panama Canal, the San Juan River was frequently used as a major part of the route from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean.  Many people, including African slaves, were transported via this route. During the California Gold Rush as many people from all over the world traveled to California to mine for gold, tens of thousands took a steamboat that was operated by the Accessory Transit Company and was directed by Cornelius Vanderbilt.[tpl]cite book|author=Greenberg, Amy S.|title=Manifest manhood and the Antebellum American empire|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|year=2005|isbn=0-521-84096-1[/tpl] The boat travelled up the San Juan River and across Lake Nicaragua; a stagecoach completed the connection to the Pacific coast.

[[Muhammad Shamsuddeen III]]

CATEGORIES: Sultans of the Maldives, Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George, 1879 births, 1935 deaths

Sultan Muhammad Shamsuddeen Iskander III, CMG, (Dhivehi: ސުލްޠާން މުޙައްމަދު ޝަމްސުއްދީން; 20 October 1879 – 12 March 1935) son of Ibrahim Nooraddeen and Kakaage Don Goma, was the Sultan of the Maldives first from 7 May 1893 and then again from 1902.
When he was 14 years, after the death of his father Sultan Ibrahim Nooraddeen, he was nominated as the Sultan only after the people expressed their dissatisfaction with the appointment of his eight-year-old half-brother as Sultan Muhammad Imaaduddeen V against the Law of Succession in the Maldive Islands. Shamsuddeen's succession to the throne was in part favoured by the fact that he was great-nephew to Muhammad Didi Ranna Baderi Kilegefanu, the prime minister to three successive Sultans, who strongly protested to the Ceylon Governor in Colombo on behalf of his discarded great-nephew.
From Malé, Shamsuddeen wrote to his great-uncle, to return and resume the post of prime minister. At this time Haajee Imaaduddeen, nephew of the late sultan Nooraddeen, who would take over the throne after 2 months, ran the country. Ibrahim Didi and some other members of the Council of Ministers ('little knowing what evil a decade was to bring forth') encouraged Haajee Imaaduddeen to seize the throne from the young sultan as they despised Muhammad Didi's complete control over his grandnephew Sultan Shamsuddeen. However the enthronement was based on the specious plea stating a unanimous dissatisfaction by the people regarding the existing sultanate with a 'mere lad as Sultan, not able to do or undo anything himself'. By this decree Haajee Imaaduddeen was raised to the throne and named Sultan Muhammad Imaaduddeen VI, with Ibrahim Didi as his prime minister.
Shamsuddeen came back to power again in 1902 after the peaceful Malé Revolution which took place while Sultan Muhammad Imaaduddeen VI temporarily quit his kingdom with the object of marrying the high-born Egyptian Sharifa Hanim, the daughter of Abd-ur Rakhman Khami Bhey, the Consul of Persia. Muhammad Shamsuddeen III's full coronation ceremony (the Ceremony of the Assumption of the State Sword of the Kingdom of the Maldive Islands) was not held until 27 July 1905. The ceremony was attended by Sir John Keene on behalf of Edward VII, the Katheeb of Kelaa of Thiladhummathi Atoll on behalf of the inhabitants of the northern atolls of the kingdom and the Katheeb of Isdhū of Haddhunmathi Atoll on behalf of the inhabitants of the southern atolls of the kingdom.
He was arrested on 2 October 1934 and was banished to Fuvahmulah with crown prince Henveyru Ganduvaru Manippulhu. The crown prince died there but later the Sultan was brought to Malé Atoll Villigili. The sultan died in Malé at the residence of Moonimaa'ge.
He is credited with bringing the first Constitution of Maldives on 22 December 1932.

A hypsometer is an instrument used in hypsometry, which estimates the elevation by boiling water – water boils at different temperatures depending on the air pressure, and thus altitude.
On Earth, the elevations can take on either positive or negative (underwater) values, and are bimodal due to the contrast between the continents and oceans.  On other planets within this solar system, elevations are typically unimodal, owing to the lack of oceans on those bodies.

Mirsad Bešlija (born 6 July 1979) is a Bosnian football player  who is currently playing for Bosnian side, FK Željezničar. He has also played for the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team.
Bešlija started his career with hometown side Slaven Živinice. Although he was among the youngest players in their squad, he became an important part of the first team. He was spotted there and signed by Bosna Visoko, a first division team at that time, in 1997. He spent two seasons in Visoko, during which he was selected for the national U21 team. His rapid footballing ascent attracted the interest of FK Željezničar and he signed for them in 2000, becoming a fans' favourite during his single season in the capital.
Bešlija joined Racing Genk in July 2001, where he stayed for five years, and made over 130 league appearances, and he won the Belgian League with them in 2003-04. He moved to Heart of Midlothian during January 2006 in a deal worth £850,000 (€1.22 million), a record fee paid by the Tynecastle side. A dispute developed about whether the overall transfer fee should include agents percentages or not, leading Hearts to suspend payment after the first installment.Genk threaten Hearts over Beslija, BBC Sport, 16 June 2006. When further dialogue brought no resolution, Genk petitioned UEFA to impose a transfer embargo upon Hearts,Genk urge signing ban for Hearts , BBC Sport, 26 October 2006. however, agreement was finally reached in December 2006, with Hearts paying the entire outstanding balance.Hearts pay Belgians for Beslija, BBC Sport, 22 December 2006. 
Beslija suffered serious injury problems with Hearts and he failed to win a regular first team place. He was loaned out to Belgian club Sint-Truidense for the 2007–08 season, and he was released by Hearts in October 2008 after they reached a severance agreement.Johnstone, Darren.

[[Dmitry Kholodov]]

Dmitry Yuryevich Kholodov ([tpl]lang-ru|Дми́трий Ю́рьевич Хо́лодов[/tpl]; 21 July 1967 – 17 October 1994) was a Russian journalist who investigated corruption in the military and was assassinated on 17 October 1994 in Moscow. His assassination was the first of many killings of journalists in Russia.[tpl]cite news|title=Journalist murder still unsolved 15 years on|url=http://rt.com/news/dmitry-kholodov-murder-journalist/|accessdate=10 January 2013|newspaper=RT|date=17 October 2009[/tpl] 

==Early life and education==

Kholodov was born in Zagorsk on 21 July 1967. He studied physics.

==Career==

Kholodov began his working life alongside his parents at the defence industry institute in Klimovsk in the Moscow Region. Faced by limited career prospects he turned to journalism, first working for the local radio. In 1992, he became a reporter with the national Moskovsky Komsomolets daily newspaper.Yekaterina Deyeva, "Dima", Moskovsky komsomolets, 3 July 2002 cited in CJES bulletin. He was murdered while investigating alleged corruption among the upper ranks of the Russian military.
In 1993, Kholodov travelled to hotspots around the former Soviet Union, reporting for Moskovsky Komsomolets. In particular, he was in Abkhazia during the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict and, as he witnessed the ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia, sent many detailed reports, including one entitled "Sukhumi apocalypse".
In October 1993 Kholodov interviewed Defence Minister Pavel Grachev. For the next twelve months, on the basis of leaks from army and Ministry of Defence sources, he wrote and published numerous articles about high-level corruption in the military, especially concerning the misuse of funds intended to ease the withdrawal and resettlement of half a million former Soviet troops and their families who had been based in East Germany. Kholodov was due to speak at Duma hearings into these allegations, which supposedly reached as high as the Defence Minister himself, when he was murdered.See Kholodov case study in PARTIAL JUSTICE: An inquiry into the deaths of journalists in Russia, June 2009. None of the allegations were ever tested in court. Grachev was replaced as Defence Minister in 1996 after the end of the First Chechen War.

==Assassination==

Kholodov died on 17 October 1994 when he opened a booby-trapped briefcase in his newspaper's offices. He had picked up the case that morning from the left-luggage section at a Moscow train station after being told it contained documents exposing corruption in the armed forces. The editors of Kholodov's daily, Moskovsky Komsomolets, accused the Russian military leadership (Defence Minister Grachev in particular) of ordering the killing. The military denied involvement. Speaking as a witness in court some six years later, Pavel Grachev claimed that "some of my subordinates misunderstood my words".Closing speech of lead prosecutor Irina Alyoshina (in Russian).
Local and foreign correspondents had already died in Moscow and elsewhere in the country (see List of journalists killed in Russia), but this was the first indisputable targeting of a journalist for his work.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl] Kholodov's murder sent shockwaves through Russia's media community. Reaction abroad was muted, apart from professional media monitors and human rights organisations, and after December 1994 his killing was overshadowed by the onset of the First Chechen War. Kholodov's violent death personalized the risk faced by reporters in Russia, and the long drawn-out investigation and subsequent failure to convict the suspects had a chilling effect on investigative journalism in the country's newly free media.
The case remains unique. With one exception (Oleg Sedinko in 2002), explosives have never again been used to kill a journalist in Russia; and unlike the ongoing spate of contract killings no evidence was presented in court that money had been paid to Kholodov's alleged killers. They were acting, apparently, to avoid the displeasure of their superiors and to advance their careers.

==Trial and acquittal==

The trial of six defendants, four of them serving military officers, began in 2000 at the Moscow District Military Court (see Russian courts). They were acquitted in 2002 and again, after a second trial, in 2004. On both occasions the Prosecutor General's Office protested against the verdict to the RF Supreme Court.Closing speech, Irina Alyoshina (in Russian).

An attempt was made to have a complaint about the lack of a fair trial examined before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. It was rejected on the grounds that the murder preceded Russia's full accession to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in 1998. By 2004 the killing was also technically beyond the statute of limitation for murder laid down in Russia's 1960 Criminal Code. Speaking in Germany in 2008, however, President Dmitry Medvedev said that the killings of certain journalists were of such importance that there should be no time limit for three prosecution of those responsible.See report (in Russian) by Nina Ognianova, Committee to Protect Journalists. Kholodov's case was still unsolved as of 2009.

Quelimane ([tpl]IPA-pt|keliˈmani[/tpl]) is a seaport in Mozambique. It is the administrative capital of the Zambezia Province and the province's largest city, and stands [tpl]convert|25|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from the mouth of the Rio dos Bons Sinais (or "River of the Good Signs").  The river was named when Vasco da Gama, on his way to India, reached it and saw "good signs" that he was on the right path. The town was the end point of David Livingstone's famous west-to-east crossing of south-central Africa in 1856. Portuguese is the official language of Mozambique, and many residents of the areas surrounding Quelimane speak Portuguese. The most common local language is Chuabo. Quelimane, along with much of Zambezia Province, is extremely prone to floods during Mozambique's rainy season. The most recent bout of severe flooding took place in January 2007.

==History==

===Pre-colonial era===

The town originated as a Swahili trade centre, and then grew as a slave market. Quelimane was founded by Muslim traders (see Kilwa Sultanate) and was one of the oldest towns in the region.

===Etymology===

The origins of the name 'Quelimane' are obscure.  One tradition alleges that Vasco da Gama, in 1498, inquired about the name of the place from some inhabitants laboring in the fields outside the settlement.  Thinking he was asking what they were doing, they simply replied kuliamani ('we are cultivating').

===Portuguese rule===

In the 16th century, the Portuguese founded a trading station at Quelimane. Sisal plantations were organized by German planters in the beginning of the 20th century. The town started to grow and attracted several communities from different backgrounds, including Muslims and Indians, and new infrastructure was built by the Portuguese authorities. Its busy port had tea, grown and processed in the district of Zambézia (particularly important in the region around Gurúè, former Vila Junqueiro), as its major export. Coconut was also produced and transformed in the city.QUELIMANE, a film of the cosmopolitan port of Quelimane and tea centre of Vila Junqueiro, Portuguese Mozambique, before 1975. By 1970, Quelimane, Portuguese Mozambique, had 71,786 inhabitants.

===After independence from Portugal===

Mozambique become independent from Portugal in 1975, after the April 1974 Carnation Revolution at Lisbon. Although its location on the Rio dos Bons Sinais is less important today than in the past, Quelimane remains a major town with a large hospital, two cathedrals, a mosque, and a public university for teachers.  Due to its heat, humidity, and distance from the beach, Quelimane is not among Mozambique's major tourist destinations.  However, its status as a provincial capital and the fourth-largest city in Mozambique and the increasing ease of access by plane (Linhas Aéreas de Moçambique runs flights) and road contribute to a small but relatively steady stream of visitors. In addition, Quelimane is home to branches of many NGOs, including World Vision International, Heifer International, and Save the Children UK. Frequent visits from foreign aid consultants, workers, and government officials also contribute to the economy, and the city received a further boost when Quelimane hosted the Ninth Annual Frelimo Party Convention in November 2006. After decades of municipal decline, the current mayor, Manuel de Araujo, is reportedly overseeing a renewed civic effort at economic and infrastructural restoration http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-radio-and-tv-21831810.

[[Americanist phonetic notation]]

CATEGORIES: Phonetic alphabets

Americanist phonetic notation (variously called North Americanist Phonetic Alphabet, or APA) is a system of phonetic notation originally developed by European and American anthropologists and language scientists (students of Neo-grammarians) for the phonetic and phonemic transcription of Native American and European languages.  It is still commonly used by linguists working on Slavic, Indic, Uralic, Semitic, and Caucasian languages. The term "Americanist phonetic alphabet" is misleading because it has always been widely used outside the Americas. For example, a version of it is the standard for the transcription of Arabic in articles published in the Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, the journal of the German Oriental Society.
Certain Americanist symbols have been used as nonstandard variants of IPA symbols in certain transcriptions.

==History==

John Wesley Powell used an early set of phonetic symbols in his publications (particularly Powell 1880) on American language families, although the choice of symbols had its origins in work by other phoneticians and American writers (e.g., Pickering 1820; Cass 1821a, 1821b; Hale 1846; Lepsius 1855, 1863; Gibbs 1861; and Powell 1877). The influential anthropologist, Franz Boas used a somewhat different set of symbols (Boas 1911). Boas' alphabet was greatly expanded upon with the publication of American Anthropological Society (1916). This alphabet was modified and discussed in articles in Bloomfield & Bolling (1927) and Herzog et al. (1934). The Americanist notation may be seen in the journals, American Anthropologist, International Journal of American Linguistics, and Language. Useful sources explaining the symbols and/or with comparisons of the alphabets used at different times are Campbell (1997:xii-xiii), Goddard (1996:10-16), Langacker (1972:xiii-vi), Mithun (1999:xiii-xv), and Odden (2005).
It is often useful to compare the Americanist tradition with another widespread tradition, International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Unlike the IPA, Americanist phonetic notation does not require a strict harmony among character styles: letters from the Greek and Roman alphabets are used side-by-side. Another contrasting feature is that the Americanist tradition relies heavily on diacritics where the IPA, which reserves diacritics for specific uses, relies on newly created Greek and Roman letters with character shape modifications. The reason for these differences is the result of a different philosophy. The Americanist linguists were interested in a phonetic notation that could be easily created from typefaces of existing orthographies. This was seen as more practical and more cost-efficient, as many of the characters chosen already existed in Greek and East European orthographies.
Abercrombie (1991:44-45) recounts the following concerning the Americanist tradition:
 In America phonetic notation has had a curious history. Bloomfield used IPA notation in his early book An Introduction to the Study of Language, 1914, and in the English edition of his more famous Language, 1935. But since then, a strange hostility has been shown by many American linguists to IPA notation, especially to certain of its symbols. 
 An interesting and significant story was once told by Carl Voegelin during a symposium held in New York in 1952 on the present state of anthropology. He told how, at the beginning of the 1930s, he was being taught phonetics by, as he put it, a "pleasant Dane", who made him use the IPA symbol for sh in ship, among others. Some while later he used those symbols in some work on an American Indian language he had done for Sapir. When Sapir saw the work he "simply blew up", Voegelin said, and demanded that in future Voegelin should use ‘s wedge’ (as š was called), instead of the IPA symbol. 
 I have no doubt that the "pleasant Dane" was H. J. Uldall, one of Jones's most brilliant students, who was later to become one of the founders of glossematics, with Louis Hjelmslev. Uldall did a great deal of research into Californian languages, especially into Maidu or Nisenan. Most of the texts he collected were not published during his lifetime. It is ironic that when they were published, posthumously, by the University of California Press, the texts were "reorthographized", as the editor's introduction put it: the IPA symbols Uldall had used were removed and replaced by others. 
 What is strange is that the IPA symbols seem so obviously preferable to the Americanist alternatives, the ‘long s’ to the ‘s wedge’, for example. As Jones often pointed out, in connected texts, for the sake of legibility diacritics should be avoided as far as possible. Many Americanist texts give the impression of being overloaded with diacritics. 
 One may wonder why there should be such a hostility in America to IPA notation. I venture to suggest a reason for this apparently irrational attitude. The hostility derives ultimately from the existence, in most American universities, of Speech Departments, which we do not have in Britain. Speech Departments tend to be well-endowed, large, and powerful. In linguistic and phonetic matters they have a reputation for being predominantly prescriptive, and tend to be considered by some therefore to be not very scholarly. In their publications and periodicals the notation they use, when writing of pronunciation, is that of the IPA. My belief is that the last thing a member of an American Linguistics Department wants is to be mistaken for a member of a Speech Department; but if he were to use IPA notation in his writings he would certainly lay himself open to the suspicion that he was. 

==Alphabet==

===Consonants===

Below is a generalized chart of phonetic symbols used by linguists of the Americanist tradition for transcribing consonant sounds.
Notes:

====Rhotics table====

Most languages only have one phonemic rhotic consonant (only about 18% of the world's languages have more than one rhotic).[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] As a result, rhotic consonants are generally transcribed with the  character. This usage is common practice in Americanist and also other notational traditions (such as the IPA). This lack of detail, although economical and phonologically sound, requires a more careful reading of a given language's phonological description to determine the precise phonetics. A list of rhotics is given below.

====Alternate symbols====

There are many alternate symbols seen in Americanist transcription. Below are some equivalent symbols matched with the symbols shown in the consonant chart above.
In addition, many researchers use the x-haček ([tpl]unicode|x̌[/tpl]) for the voiceless uvular fricative. The use of the standard IPA belted-l ([tpl]IPA|ɬ[/tpl]) for the voiceless lateral fricative is becoming increasingly common.

===Vocalics===

Vowels and glides.
Notes:

===Diacritics===

Diacritics are widely used in Americanist notation. Unlike the IPA, which seeks to use as few diacritics as possible, the Americanist notation uses a narrow set of symbols and then relies on diacritics to indicate a sound's phonetic value.

===Historical charts of 1916===

The following chart appeared in American Anthropological Society (1916).

[[Indian Councils Act 1909]]

CATEGORIES: Legislation in British India

The Indian Councils Act 1909 (9 Edw. 7 c. 4), commonly known as the Morley-Minto Reforms, was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that brought about a limited increase in the involvement of Indians in the governance of British India.

==Morley-Minto Reforms==

John Morley, the Liberal Secretary of State for India, and the Conservative Governor-General of India, The Earl of Minto, believed that cracking down on uprising in Bengal was necessary but not sufficient for restoring stability to the British Raj after Lord Curzon's partitioning of Bengal. They believed that a dramatic step was required to put heart into loyal elements of the Indian upper classes and the growing Westernised section of the population......  
They produced the Indian Councils Act of 1909 (Morley-Minto reforms), these reforms did not go any significant distance toward meeting the Indian National Congress demand for 'the system of government obtaining in Self-Governing British Colonies'.
The act is also sometimes called minto-Morley reform but that is not the correct citation. 
The Act of 1909 was important for the following reasons:
 “To Lord Curzon's apprehension that the new Councils could become 'parliamentary bodies in miniature', Morley vehemently replied that, 'if it could be said that this chapter of reforms led directly or indirectly to the establishment of a parliamentary system in India, I for one would have nothing at all to do with it'. But he had already confessed in a letter to Minto in June 1906 that while it was inconceivable to adapt English political institutions to the 'nations who inhabit India...the spirit of English institutions is a different thing and it is a thing that we cannot escape, even if we wished...because the British constituencies are the masters, and they will assuredly insist... all parties alike... on the spirit of their own political system being applied to India.' He never got down to explaining how the spirit of the British system of government could be achieved without its body.” 
These concessions were a constant source of strife from 1909 to 1947. British statesmen generally considered reserved seats as regrettable in that they encouraged communal extremism as Muslim candidates did not have to appeal for Hindu votes and vice versa. As further power was shifted from the British to Indian politicians in 1919, 1935 and afterward, Muslims were ever more determined to hold on to if they could not expand the reserved seats and their weightage. However, Hindu politicians repeatedly tried to eliminate reserved seats as they considered them to be undemocratic and hindering the development of a shared Hindu-Muslim Indian national feeling.
In 1906, Morley announced in the British parliament that his government wanted to introduce new reforms for India, in which the locals were to be given more powers in legislative affairs. With this, a series of correspondences started between him and Lord Minto, the then Governor General of India. A committee was appointed by the Government of India to propose a scheme of reforms. The committee submitted its report, and after the approval of Lord Minto and Lord Morley, the Act of 1909 was passed by the British parliament. The Act of 1909 is commonly known as the Morley-Minto Reforms.

==Major Provisions of the Act==

The Act amended the Indian Councils Acts of 1861 and 1892.Ilbert, Sir Courtenay Peregrine. "Appendix I: Indian Councils Act, 1909", in The Government of India. Clarendon Press, 1907. pp. 427. Its major provisions are as follows:
1. The member of the Legislative Councils, both at the Center and in the provinces, were to be of four categories i.e. ex officio members (Governor General and the members of their Executive Councils), nominated official members (those nominated by the Governor General and were government officials), nominated non-official members (nominated by the Governor General but were not government officials) and elected members (elected by different categories of Indian people). 
1. The maximum number of nominated and elected members of the Legislative Council at the Center was increased from 16 to 60. The number did not include ex-officio members.Ilbert, Sir Courtenay Peregrine. "Appendix I: Indian Councils Act, 1909", in The Government of India. Clarendon Press, 1907. p. 430.
2. The maximum number of nominated and elected members of the provincial legislative councils under a governor or lieutenant-governor was also increased. It was fixed as 50 in Bengal, Bombay, Madras, United Provinces, and Eastern Bengal and Assam, and 30 in Punjab, Burma, and any lieutenant-governor province created thereafter. Legislative councils were not created for provinces under a chief commissioner.Ilbert, Sir Courtenay Peregrine. "Appendix I: Indian Councils Act, 1909", in The Government of India. Clarendon Press, 1907. pp. 430.
4. The right of separate electorate was given to the Muslims. 
5. Official members were to form the majority but in provinces non-official members would be in majority. 
6. The members of the Legislative Councils were permitted to discuss the budgets, suggest the amendments and even to vote on them; excluding those items that were included as non-vote items. They were also entitled to ask supplementary questions during the legislative proceedings. 
7. The Secretary of State for India was empowered to increase the number of the Executive Councils of Madras and Bombay from two to four. 
8. Two Indians were nominated to the Council of the Secretary of State for Indian Affairs. 
9. The Governor-General was empowered to nominate one Indian member to his Executive Council.

==Legislative Councils==

The Governor-General, with the approval of the Secretary of State for India, made regulations for how members of legislative councils were nominated or elected nominated, and their qualifications. Regulations made in accordance with the Act could not be exercised until laid before both Houses of Parliament, so that either house might object. By the regulation of November 1909, the councils were composed as follows:Ilbert, Sir Courtenay Peregrine. "Appendix II: Constitution of the Legislative Councils under the Regulations of November 1909", in The Government of India. Clarendon Press, 1907. pp. 432-5.

==Legacy==

The Indian Councils Act served as the governance structure of India for a decade. It was modified by the Government of India Act, 1912, to clarify the authority of the Governor of Bengal, to create a legislative council for the new province of Bihar and Orissa, to dispense with Parliamentary review of the creation of new legislative councils for provinces under a lieutenant-governor and to permit the creation of legislative councils in provinces under chief commissioners. The Government of India Act, 1915 consolidated 47 prior acts of Parliament relating to the governance of India into a single act of 135 sections and five schedules.Ilbert, Sir Courtenay Peregrine. The Government of India, Third Edition, revised and updated. Clarendon Press, 1922. pp. 119-122.
The Montagu-Chelmsford Commission was formed in response to increasing demands in India for home rule, and issued a report in 1917. The Government of India Act, 1919 enacted the legislative reforms recommended by the Montagu-Chelmsford Report.

René-Louis de Voyer de Paulmy, marquis d'Argenson (October 18, 1694 in Paris – January 10, 1757) was a French statesman, son of Marc-René de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson, the first Marquis d'Argenson, and brother of Marc-Pierre d'Argenson. His son Marc-René served as Minister of War and was a noted bibliophile.
From 1720 to 1724, d'Argenson was Intendant of Hainaut, became privy counsel and from 1744 foreign minister. He negotiated with the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia to form a federation of Italian states. As last representant of the anti-Habsburg faction, he was overturned by intrigues at the Spanish court and appointed president of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. 
A friend of Voltaire and the Encyclopedists, and an attendee of the Club de l'Entresol, he turned writing scientific tracts, among them Considérations sur le gouvernement ancien et présent de la France (Amsterdam, 1764), and a tract important for understanding the inner machinations of France, Essais ou loisirs d'un ministre d'état, 2 vols. (Paris, 1787), rich in commentary and descriptions of noteworthy compatriots and anecdotes. His Memoirs are also of value as affecting the early and middle parts of Louis XV's reign.
d'Argenson's works were cited by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his work The Social Contract.

CATEGORIES: 1913 births, 2002 deaths, Canadian Salvationists, English Salvationists, Officers of the Order of Canada, Protestant writers, Salvation Army officers, English emigrants to Canada

Arnold Brown, OC (13 December 1913 – 26 June 2002) was the 11th General of The Salvation Army (1977-1981).
He was born in London, England, the son of officers of The Salvation Army. While he was still a young boy, his family immigrated to Canada, and it was from the corps in Belleville that he entered training, becoming an officer in 1935. A two-year corps command was followed by 10 years of service in the editorial department at territorial headquarters, where he became assistant editor of The War Cry. During that time he compiled a history of the first 50 years of Salvation Army ministry in Canada, entitled What Hath God Wrought?
Captain Brown and Lieutenant Jean Barclay were married 15 September 1939, and they gave 42 years of joint service before retiring from active leadership. They had two daughters, Heather Jean Brown and Beverley Ann Brown.
In 1962, the then Brigadier Brown was appointed as territorial youth secretary, an appointment where he gave vigorous leadership to the young Salvationists of Canada and Bermuda. Always an inspired leader of meetings and a fascinating speaker, his ministry among the young people of the territory left an indelible mark upon the lives and service of many of them.
In 1964, there came a return to public relations work, this time at international headquarters, where Lieutenant-Colonel Brown was appointed as secretary for public relations, being promoted to the rank of colonel just a few months later. His imaginative leadership gave birth to the 'For God's Sake Care!' campaign, which raised the army's profile significantly throughout the United Kingdom, and changed the face of The Salvation Army's public relations work for all time. It was also under his direction that advisory boards were established in the UK.http://www.salvoaudio.com/sermon/general_arnold_brown.htm
Brown had a long-standing involvement with the Rotary Club movement, rising to high office in the London club and internationally. In his capacity as a Rotarian he was invited to address many international conferences, including those in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1973 and in Montreal, Canada, in 1975. Whenever he addressed Rotary, he proudly presented the story of God's Army and its contribution to the relief of suffering and need around the world.
Following an outstanding period of service in public relations, Commissioner Brown was appointed chief of the staff (the army's second-in-command) in October 1969, where he served for five years before returning to Canada as territorial commander in 1974. Three years later, the High Council of The Salvation Army elected him to become the 11th General of The Salvation Army. He took office on 5 July 1977.
Upon election, when asked what he wanted Salvationists to do, Brown said, 'Everything they can to make better known Jesus Christ and his saving power as the only hope for a sinning, suffering world; everything they can to demonstrate indisputably in what they say and do that the grace of God enables men and women to live clean and holy lives filled with the joy of service to God and their fellows; in short, everything they can to bring Heaven to earth.'
Brown and his wife travelled extensively during the four-and-a-half years he was in office. In 1980, Brown inaugurated the International Staff Songsters in London, and he continued to maintain a lively interest in their ministry, both in the UK and many other countries where they have travelled.
Brown received many honours during his lifetime, recognising his contribution to the field of literature as well as his work in the interests of the poor and underprivileged of society. He was made a Freeman of the City of London in 1978, an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1981 and, also in 1981, an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Asbury Theological Seminary and an honorary Doctor of Divinity from the Olivet Seminary in the USA.
Many books were written by Brown, including What Hath God Wrought?, The Gate and the Light (autobiography), The Mountain the Wind Blew Here, With Christ at the Table and Occupied Manger - Unoccupied Tomb. 
Brown died at age 92 in a hospital in Toronto, Canada. His remains were interred at Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto, Canada in The Salvation Army plot.

[[Svend Foyn]]

CATEGORIES: 1809 births, 1894 deaths, People from Tønsberg, Norwegian whalers, Norwegian explorers

Svend Foyn (July 9, 1809  –  November 30, 1894)  was a Norwegian whaling and shipping magnate who pioneered revolutionary methods for hunting and processing whales. Svend Foyn introduced the modern harpoon gun and brought whaling into a modern age.Foyn’s bomb-tipped harpoon fired from a gun forever changed whaling''. (Marine Science. Modern Whaling)

==Background==

Svend Foyn was born at Foynegården in  Tønsberg,  the son of shipmaster Laurentius Foyn and Benthe Marie Ager.  Svend Foyn wed Elise Amalie Tvede in 1839 in a marriage which ended in an amicable separation in 1842.  His former wife, later known as Elise Wærenskjold, immigrated to Texas in 1847. Foyn maintained a long distance friendship with his ex-wife throughout the remainder of their lives. In 1849, Foyn married Magdalene Margrethe “Lena” Bull, with whom he would be married for the remainder of his life.Amalie Tvede Wærenskjold'' (Handbook of Texas)

==Career==

The whole process of whaling was changed drastically when Svend Foyn invented the exploding harpoon. By doing so, he removed much of the danger from whaling although it remained a very dangerous undertaking. His invention increased the efficiency by which whales could be captured and made it possible to hunt the larger and faster rorquals, the largest group of baleen whales.Whaling, 1861-1987'', (New Bedford Whaling Museum)
Svend Foyn introduced mechanized, steam-powered catcher boats equipped with bow-chaser deck cannons and heavy-caliber harpoons that exploded on impact. Foyn constructed his 86-ton, seven-knot Spes et Fides, the first steam-powered whale catcher. The ship was equipped with seven whale guns separately mounted on the forecastle, each firing a harpoon and grenade. The vessel was 94 feet (29 m) long, with a 20-horsepower (15-kW) engine. It could reach a speed of 7 knots (13 km/h).Modern Whaling, 1861-1987 (New Bedford Whaling Museum) 
Svend Foyn patented his grenade harpoon gun in 1870. He modified existing designs and utilized ideas developed by Erik Eriksen. It consisted of a cannon that fired a barbed explosive head harpoon.  Aimed and fired, the harpoon barb would hook into the whale. A moment later an explosive charge in the head of the harpoon would inflict a mortal wound. Then the whale was retrieved by a winch. Once alongside the whaling vessel, the whale was pumped full of air to keep it afloat, as the whale was moved to the location of processing.Harpoon Gun''(Arctic Website)
With this development, he launched Norway into a new and profitable industry. After years of perfecting a cannon that could fire a grenade and harpoon simultaneously, Foyn finally managed to catch 30 whales in 1868. These increased efficiency and volume, enabling the harvest not only of all of the species that had been hunted for, but also the largest species which had eluded all previous hunting technologies. The whaling industry was in decline when Foyn first began his development of the bow-mounted harpoon cannon. Foyn's eventual successful development of the cannon, in combination with fast and sleek steam-powered catcher vessels, ushered in a modern whaling industry that was to become dominated first by the Norwegians, then the British and finally the Russians and Japanese.Whaling - Whales and Whaling''(Cool Antarctica)
The Antarctic Expedition of 1894–95 was funded by Svend Foyn and led by Henrik Johan Bull. The expedition was a whaling expedition that sailed to the Ross Sea  aboard  the ship Antarctic.  
Svend Foyn's worker's homes, restored and protected flats for workers built 1857–70. In 1865 there were 73 flats and 303 residents. There was a library, prayer room and the country's first kindergarten. Svend Foyn was not only a man before his time in the modern whaling industry, but also as regards social conditions. Svend and Lena Foyn's Memorial, a home for elderly ladies founded by Lena Foyn in 1896. Since 1983 the building has been used for business purposes. Svend Foyn's Chapel, was consecrated November 5, 1876. There was seating for 500 people and at the time it was Norway's largest and most beautiful chapel.

==Svend Foyn residence==

The former residence of Svend and Lena Foyn on Storgaten  in Tønsberg is a protected house. Built in 1700, Svend Foyn's complete townhouse complex is a shipowner's house from 1750, and Svend Foyn's childhood home, protected in 1924. It is the only complete house of its style from the 18th century in the town.Svend and Lena Foyn (Go Norway)

==Later years==

Foyn was entered as a Knight in the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1853, was promoted to Commander in 1870 and received the Grand Cross in 1893. Foyn died in 1894 in Nøtterøy,  followed by the death of his widow Lena in 1905.

[[Lithuania and the euro]]

CATEGORIES: Euro by country, Coins of Lithuania, Lithuania and the European Union

Lithuania is an EU member state, and as such also a member of the Economic and Monetary Union. Its currency, the  litas, has been pegged to the euro at 3.4528 litas to 1 euro since 2002, and it has been part of ERM II since 28 June 2004, shortly after the country joined the EU on 1 May 2004.

However, Lithuania has not yet met all the economic criteria necessary to join the euro.

==Status==

All members of the European Union, except Denmark and the UK, are required by treaty to join the euro once certain economic criteria have been met. In March 2006, Lithuania requested that the European Commission and the European Central Bank conduct an assessment on their readiness to adopt the euro. The Commission's report found that while Lithuania met 4 of the 5 criteria, their average annual inflation was 2.7%, exceeding the limit of 2.6%. As a result, the Commission concluded that "there should be no change at present to Lithuania's status as a Member State with a derogation."[tpl]cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/06/622&format=PDF&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en|title=Commission assesses the state of convergence in Lithuania|date=2006-05-16|accessdate=2014-01-12|publisher=European Commission[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/euro/euro-zone-slovenia-lithuania-hold/article-155340|title=Euro zone: Slovenia in, Lithuania on hold|date=2006-05-16|accessdate=2014-01-12[/tpl]  Lithuania is the only country to be rejected in the attempt to adopt the euro.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/a0ca35e0-54f9-11e3-86bc-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2q2ZBK2f1|title=Lithuania shows rare enthusiasm for eurozone membership|date=2013-12-30|accessdate=2014-01-12|last1=Milne|first1=Richard|last2=Spiegel|first2=Peter|publisher=Financial Times[/tpl]

==Lithuanian euro design==

The proposed design of the Lithuanian euro coins share a similar national side for all denominations, featuring the Vytis symbol and the name of the country, "Lietuva".  The design was announced on 11 November 2004 following a public opinion poll conducted by the Bank of Lithuania.

CATEGORIES: Field armies of Germany in World War II, Military units and formations disestablished in 1945

The 16th Army ([tpl]lang-de|16. Armee[/tpl]) was a World War II field army of the Wehrmacht.
It took part in the Battle of France. It was then deployed with Army Group North during Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. It fought its way into northern Russia where in January 1942 part of it was encircled by the Soviets near Demyansk. Hitler forbade a withdrawal and the Army was re-supplied by air until a land corridor was opened in April 1942. It was subsequently involved in the siege of Leningrad. The Soviets relieved Leningrad in January 1944.
On February 19, 1944, the Soviet 2nd Baltic Front launched a fresh set of attacks against the German 16th Army around Kholm. The Soviet 22nd Army made good progress in the initial assault. These attacks greatly diminished the 16th Army. It, along with the 18th Army was cut off in the Courland Peninsula when the Soviets launched their summer and autumn offensives of 1944. It stayed trapped there until the end of the war. After the war, 250,000 German troops trapped in the Courland Pocket were marched into captivity, many were never heard from again.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]

[[Planar chirality]]

CATEGORIES: Stereochemistry

Planar chirality is the special case of chirality for two dimensions.
Most fundamentally, planar chirality is a mathematical term, finding use in chemistry, physics and related physical sciences, for example, in astronomy, optics and metamaterials. Recent occurrences in latter two fields are dominated by microwave applications and micro- and nanostructured planar interfaces for visible and infrared light.

==Planar chirality in chemistry==

This term is used in chemistry contexts,IUPAC. Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd ed. (the "Gold Book"). Compiled by A. D. McNaught and A. Wilkinson. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford (1997). XML on-line corrected version: http://goldbook.iupac.org (2006-) created by M. Nic, J. Jirat, B. Kosata; updates compiled by A. Jenkins. ISBN 0-9678550-9-8. http://dx.doi.org/10.1351/goldbook.P04681 e.g., for a chiral molecule lacking an asymmetric carbon atom, but possessing two non-coplanar rings that are each dissymmetric and which cannot easily rotate about the chemical bond connecting them: 2,2'-dimethylbiphenyl is perhaps the simplest example of this case. Planar chirality is also exhibited by molecules like (E)-cyclooctene, some di- or poly-substituted metallocenes, and certain monosubstituted paracyclophanes. Nature rarely provides planar chiral molecules, cavicularin being an exception.

===Assigning the configuration of planar chiral molecules===

To assign the configuration of a planar chiral molecule, begin by selecting the pilot atom, which is the highest priority of the atoms that is not in the plane, but are directly attached to an atom in the plane. Next, assign the priority of three adjacent in-plane atoms, starting with the atom attached to the pilot atom as priority 1, and preferentially assigning in order of highest priority if there is a choice. When viewed from the side of the pilot atom, if the three atoms form a clockwise direction when followed in order of priority, the molecule is assigned as R, otherwise it is assigned as S.Kalsi, P.S. "Stereochemistry Conformation and Mechanism"

==Planar chirality in optics and metamaterials==

The study of planar chiral metamaterials has revealed that planar chirality is associated with an optical effect: the directionally asymmetric transmission (reflection and absorption) of circularly polarized waves. Planar chiral metamaterials, which are also anisotropic and lossy exhibit different total transmission (reflection and absorption) levels for the same circularly polarized wave incident on their front and back.
The asymmetric transmission phenomenon arises from different, e.g. left-to-right, circular polarization conversion efficiencies for opposite propagation directions of the incident wave and therefore the effect is referred to as circular conversion dichroism.
Like the twist of a planar chiral pattern appears reversed for opposite directions of observation, planar chiral metamaterials have interchanged properties for left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized waves that are incident on their front and back. In particular left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized waves experience opposite directional transmission (reflection and absorption) asymmetries [ref]

His 1907 work L'individualisme économique et social (Individualism - Economic and Social) first outlines a basis for the classical liberal doctrine, in France to be traced back to the Physiocrats. Then he talks about the diverse aspect of individualism in the 19th century: from Charles Dunoyer to Mill, and to Bastiat. He also talks about individualism in relation to politics (liberal democracy), its relationship to religion, and finally to Spencer's sociology, and anarchism.

CATEGORIES: 1963 television episodes, The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series) episodes, Works based on the Faust legend, Fictional portrayals of the Devil

"Printer's Devil" is an episode of the American television anthology series The Twilight Zone. The title comes from the expression printer's devil, an apprentice in the industry.
The initial plot set-up borrows from the classic American short story "The Devil and Daniel Webster", although this tale ultimately goes in a different direction.  This  hour-long episode was written by Charles Beaumont, and based on his 1951 short story "The Devil, You Say".

==Plot==

Douglas Winter, the editor of The Courier, a failing newspaper, feels there is nothing to live for after a number of employees quit, including the Linotype operator. On a bridge while drunk, he looks down into the inviting water below. When he is going to commit suicide, he is approached by one "Mr. Smith", who comments that it's a short fall and probably wouldn't do a very good job. He then asks Doug for a light, and, if he wasn't quite ready, a ride into town. Amused and forgetting about suicide, Winter gives him a lift to a café, where Mr. Smith agrees to provide the editor with money to pay off debts and continue the operation of the newspaper. Mr. Smith also signs up to replace the linotype operator and be the sole reporter. With nothing to lose, Doug agrees to the proposition.
The first scoop is a large bank robbery. Business booms for the little newspaper, as Mr. Smith out-scoops other reporters from the rival Gazette on dramatic news stories, many involving disasters. The Courier becomes a success as its stories hit the streets seemingly minutes after the events happen. It is so successful that a man from The Gazette, Mr. Franklin, tries to buy up the little newspaper. Winter is now in a position to say "No!" with confidence. Not many days later, there is a fire at The Gazette, and they accuse someone at The Courier of arson.
With all the success the newspaper is having, Mr. Smith asks the editor to humor him by signing a contract guaranteeing continued success as the newspaper editor in exchange for his immortal soul, pointing out that it doesn't mean much; "it's almost like an appendix these days, not really necessary," and besides, since the devil is not real, Winter shouldn't have a problem with it. Winter hesitates, but Mr. Smith goads him by saying, "Imagine a grown man believing in the devil!" More importantly, Mr. Smith has modified the newspaper's linotype machine so that whatever is set in type subsequently happens.
Eventually, Mr. Smith makes a pass at Miss Benson, who sternly rebuffs him. Mr. Smith vows that Benson will pay the price. In retaliation for this, and trying to turn the screws on Winter, he writes a story that has the editor's girlfriend gravely injured in an auto accident. The editor concludes that Mr. Smith is, in fact, the devil, and he discovers the story that has his girlfriend apparently dying. Smith demands that Winter kill himself to fulfill his part of their bargain, or Jackie dies.  In desperation, Winter uses the linotype machine to change the story so that his girlfriend survives the crash (with Mr. Smith himself the catalyst behind the steering wheel, trying to destroy Jackie as well), but also writes it so that Mr. Smith's contract is rendered void, and he must leave. When the car is found, Jackie is safe in the passenger seat, but Mr. Smith has vanished. Winter decides to run the newspaper fairly and to destroy the infernal linotype machine.

Estadio Agustín "Coruco" Díaz is a football (soccer) stadium named in honour of a local player named Agustín "Coruco" Díaz. It has a capacity of 16,000 seatswww.fussballtempel.net and is home to the team Cañeros de Zacatepec.
This stadium is one of the oldest in Mexico and its origins can be traced back to 1948. It is located in Zacatepec, Morelos. The official opening of this stadium was in November 1954. This stadium is nicknamed the Selva Cañera ("Sugar Cane Jungle") because of the tropical weather that distinguish the municipality of Zacatepec. There was a very famous player and later coach named Ignacio Trelles, who ordered to irrigate the field one hour before the soccer match, leading to a very strong vaporization and an increase of the  temperature to near 40 Celsius (more or less 100 Fahrenheit), that was very hard for the visitor squads. Another oddity of this building is that is it located very central in the town of Zacatepec and beside the sugar cane refineries.

John Grattan Hendrie (born 24 October 1963) is a Scottish former professional association footballer who played on the right wing or in attack.
His career started at Coventry City but he moved to Bradford City, where he played 173 consecutive league games, winning one promotion and narrowly missing out on another. Following spells with Newcastle United and Leeds United, he moved to Middlesbrough and scored the final goal at Ayresome Park among his 44 goals for Boro. When he was replaced by Brazilian Juninho he moved to Barnsley where he finished his career and also served as manager.
His uncle is another Scottish former pro footballer, Paul Hendrie. Paul has two sons (John's cousins) in the game; Lee Hendrie made a late substitute appearance for England in 1998 and Stuart Hendrie plays for Morecambe.

==Playing career==

===Coventry City===

Hendrie started his professional football career at Coventry City, originally signing as an apprentice in June 1980, and signing full-time forms in May 1981. He was a hit with Coventry's reserves, being top scorer in 1983–84, with ten goals from 25 games, but he struggled to break into the first team and played in just 21 league games during his time at Coventry. Instead he moved on a free transfer to Bradford City in 1984 following a loan spell with Hereford United.

===Bradford City===

Hendrie was one of two free transfers between the 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons, along with Dave Evans, as manager Trevor Cherry tried to build a team capable of promotion from Division Three. Hendrie was an ever-present in his first season scoring nine goals from his right wing position as City won the Division Three title. On the last day of that successful season his day was to turn into a nightmare when 56 spectators were killed in a horrendous stand fire while playing Lincoln City.
Hendrie continued to be one of the first names of the City team-sheet following promotion and during his four seasons at City he missed just one league game. He won a series of fans' awards and nominations for the PFA teams in 1987 and 1988. He scored ten goals in 1985–86 and 14 more in 1986–87. Cherry had been replaced by Terry Dolan, who built a team pushing for promotion to Division One in 1987–88. Hendrie was one of the key men, scoring 13 goals, but he was sent off in a 2–2 draw at Manchester City on 23 April 1988. His subsequent suspension meant he missed the final league game of the season, as City lost 3–2 to Ipswich Town and missed out on promotion. It was the only league game Hendrie missed during his time at Valley Parade, and his 173 consecutive league appearances has only been beaten by Geoff Smith with City. Hendrie came back for the play-off games with Middlesbrough but after defeat he signed for Newcastle United for £500,000.

===Newcastle United and Leeds United===

Hendrie's career stalled at Newcastle United in a difficult season for the Magpies and he soon moved on to Leeds United. He spent just one season at Leeds but was voted in the top 100 Leeds players in 2000.

===Middlesbrough===

He played as a deep-lying striker for Middlesbrough and helped them win promotion to the newly founded FA Premier League in 1992, and was their leading scorer in 1995 when they won promotion back to the top flight.  He secured legendary status on Teesside by scoring the last ever goal at Ayresome Park.

===Barnsley===

He left the following year after losing his place in the first team to Juninho Paulista, and joined Division One side Barnsley. Once again, Hendrie contributed towards his club winning promotion as Barnsley finished Division One runners-up and became top division members for the first time in their history. Hendrie was unable to prevent Barnsley from suffering relegation in 1997–98, and after the end of the season he succeeded Danny Wilson as manager.

==Managerial career==

However, John Hendrie's management career was a disappointment or so it seemed at the time. He was sacked on 19 April 1999 after just one season in charge of Barnsley, having failed to get anywhere near the promotion or even play off places. Having said that, the club were mid-table, had enjoyed a good run in the FA Cup, reaching the quarter-finals and also enjoyed a good run in the League Cup. In comparison with what has happened to Barnsley since 2002, Hendrie's record looks quite creditable.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]

[[Pouppée Fabrikk]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic body music, Swedish musical groups

Pouppée Fabrikk is a Swedish EBM band, started in 1988 by Henrik Björkk and Leif Holm, who both hail from Karlskoga. 
Initially, the music of Pouppée Fabrikk (PF) borrowed heavily from minimalistic electronic acts such as Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft and Nitzer Ebb, but with the addition of Jouni Olilla and Jonas Aneheim on guitar PF moved towards a more Die Krupps-style electronic/metal mix. The "Your Pain - Our Gain" CD was meant to be released in 1996, but due to differences in opinion between the band and the record company (Energy Rekords) it was delayed until 1999. In 1996 the band decided to take a break and PF was put on hold and the band members worked on various solo projects. 
In 2000 the band re-united for a gig at the Tinitus Electronic Festival and announced that they were making a comeback and returning to their roots. They released a four track mini CD entitled "Elite Electronics". A year later though, both Jouni and Henrik left the band to concentrate on their respective solo careers. PF disbanded shortly afterwards. After seven years of absence from the scene the band re-united in 2009, Christian R filling the place of former member Jouni Ollila. In October 2010, they once again re-united for a gig; this time at Bodyfest on Fryshuset.

CATEGORIES: Operas by George Frideric Handel, Italian-language operas, 1723 operas, Operas

[tpl]Handel operas[/tpl]Flavio, re de' Longobardi (Flavio, King of the Lombards, HWV 16) is an opera in three acts by George Frideric Handel.  The Italian-language libretto was by Nicola Francesco Haym, after Matteo Noris's Il Flavio Cuniberto.  It was Handel's fourth full-length opera for the Royal Academy of Music.  Handel had originally entitled the opera after the character of Emilia in the opera.Dean, Winton, "A Handel Tragicomedy" (August 1969).  The Musical Times, 110 (1518): pp. 819-822.
Handel completed the score only seven days before the premiere, at the King's Theatre in the Haymarket on 14 May 1723.  There were eight performances in the premiere run.King, Richard G., Review of J. Merrill Knapp's edition of Flavio, Re de' Langobardi (HWV 16) (December 1994).  Notes (2nd Ser.), 51 (2): pp. 746-748.  The work was revived on 18 April 1732, under the direction of the composer, for four performances.  

==Performance history==

There were no further revivals until it was rediscovered and performed in Göttingen on 2 July 1967.  The first UK performance since Handel's time was on 26 August 1969 at the Unicorn Theatre, Abingdon, England.

==Roles==

==Synopsis==

===Prologue===

The setting is Lombardy.  King Flavio rules both Lombardy and England.  His two counselors are Ugone and Lotario. Ugone's son, Guido, is set to marry Lothario's daughter, Emilia, this day. Ugone also has a daughter, Teodata. He desires her to seek a position as a lady-in-waiting at the court in order "to avoid the bitter solitude of her maiden years".  He does not know that she already has a secret lover, Vitige, the King's adjutant.

===Act 1===

In front of the aged Ugone's house, before dawn, Vitige is leaving Teodata's chamber; the two sing a duet ("Ricordati, mio ben".  Next, at the hall in Lotario's house, Guido's marriage to Emilia takes place in the house of the bride's father attended only by close relatives. The bride and bridegroom sing of their bliss, then separate until the wedding celebration in the evening.  Following, at the King's castle, Ugone presents Teodata to the King and says that she wishes to enter his service as a lady-in-waiting.  Enraptured by Teodato's beauty, Flavio assents and assigns her to his wife, Ernelinda.
Lotario invites the King to the wedding feast.  Flavio then receives a letter from the elderly Governor of England, Narsete, who requests to be relieved of his post.  Flavio's first reaction is to appoint Lotario as the replacement.  Lotario begins to savour the prospect of the post, but Flavio changes his mind in favour of Ugone, because he wants Ugone out of the way so that he can pursue Teodata without interference.  Lotario feels slighted and leaves, angry.  Flavio apostrophises to Vitige on Teodata's beauty, unaware that Vitige is already beloved of Teodata.  Vitige tries to conceal his feelings by saying that he does not find the lady particularly pleasing of eye.
In the castle courtyard, Ugone meets his son Guido with the news that Lotario has slapped him.  Ugone must now defend his honour, but is too old to wield a sword.  He asks his son to fight the duel in his place, which puts Guido in a conflict between his duty to his father and his love for Emilia, to whom he has just become betrothed.  He then proudly proclaims his decision to defend his family honour.  Emilia then arrives, not understanding why Guido tried to fly from her, and vows eternal constancy to him.  She notices that he seems different in mood.

===Act 2===

In a hall in the castle, Flavio is courting Teodata.  Ugone rushes in, too distressed to speak coherently.  Flavio leaves the room.  Ugone is raving about the loss of the family honour. Teodata thinks that her liaison with Vitige has been discovered and tearfully confesses. Ugone's distress increases upon learning this new situation of his daughter.
At Lotario's house, Lotario tells Emilia that he does not wish to lose his daughter to the son of his hated rival and tells her that her marriage is null and void.  Guido, in search of Lotario, requests Emilia to leave him alone for a while. 
At the castle, Flavio orders his adjutant to bring Teodata to him. Vitige tells of his unhappy mission to Teodata, and Teodata tells Vitige that her father has found out about her secret betrothal.  To try to hold the King off for a while, they devise a plan where Vitige should pretend to solicit her love for him, and Teodata will feign willingness.
At the courtyard of Lotario's house, Guido challenges Lotario to a duel.  Lotario scoffs at the young man's challenge, but accepts.  In the combat, Lotario falls.  When Emilia arrives, Lotario names Guido as his murderer and dies.  In despair, she swears vengeance, but is torn because this means vengenance on her beloved, Guido.

===Act 3===

At the castle, Emilia and Ugone beg the King for justice. She demands the death penalty for her father's murderer, while he pleads for his son's life. Overwhelmed by the events, Flavio asks for time to reflect and sends them away. Vitige then enters with Teodata, whose presence renders Flavio speechless.  He tries to have Vitige woo her on his behalf.  Finally, Flavio undertakes it himself, calling Teodata "my queen" and trying to conduct her into his bedchamber.  Vitige's heart becomes "a raging sea" of jealousy.
Emilia is in mourning, for her father and for her fugitive Guido, but then she once again vows implacable vengeance.  Guido appears and hands his sword to her that she might kill him. Emilia takes it, but lets it fall and leaves. Guido begs the god of love for help. 
Vitige and Teodata quarrel, accusing one another of having gone too far in the hoodwinking of the King and having allowed the game to become serious.  They discover that Flavio has entered and overheard everything.  They admit to being lovers, which crushes Flavio.
Guido enters and begs the King to have him put to death if Emilia still hates him for his deed. Ugone then confesses that he incited his son to commit it in his place.  Flavio, freshly aware of his responsibilities as king, sends for Emilia.  He tells Guido to conceal himself and listen to the proceedings.  Flavio tells Emilia that Guido has been executed as she had requested, and that she may see his head as proof.  She refuses and begs to be killed, too, since without Guido her life is meaningless.  Guido emerges from his hiding-place and she almost faints for joy.  Guido begs for forgiveness, and she asks for a period of mourning.
Flavio then decrees that Vitige must marry the lady whom he did not find pleasing to behold (i.e. Teodata), and that Ugone will be banished from the realm, but to England to become Governor.  Ugone must also acknowledge his son-in-law, Guido.  All thank the King, and the opera ends with a chorus of reconciliation.

[[The High and the Mighty (1954 song)]]

CATEGORIES: 1954 songs, Songs with music by Dimitri Tiomkin, Songs with lyrics by Ned Washington, Songs from films

"The High and the Mighty" is a song by Ned Washington and Dimitri Tiomkin from the film of the same name.The High and the Mighty, Soundtracks 
At the start of the film's production late in 1953, veteran film composer and musician Dimitri Tiomkin was commissioned to write the film's score.  The studio also urged Tiomkin to come up with a theme song for the film, to be released to radio and as a vinyl record. Tiomkin formed the basic melody to the song and enlisted songwriter Ned Washington to write the song's lyrics. What resulted was a gentle ballad. Warner Bros. presented the song to Les Baxter and his Orchestra, who recorded and released the song to coincide with the release of the film. When released in 1954, "The High and the Mighty" peaked at #4 on the Billboard Pop chart. 
Both the film score and the song were nominated for Academy Awards in 1955. The song (did not win) was sung by Johnny Desmond, accompanied by Muzzy Marcellino at the Awards Television show.Academy Award nominations Best Original Song Dimitri Tiomkin's score won the Academy Award that year.
Toward the end of the film, after John Wayne's character convinced the captain to try to make it to San Francisco rather than ditch, the captain said "Whistle me a tune, Dan. I like music when I work." Dan (John Wayne) whistled a bit of "I'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech" (Georgia Tech's famous and catchy fight song). Audiences at the time no doubt immediately recognized it and understood it was a sign of success, as Georgia Tech was in its glory years in football under Bobby Dodd, during which it won six bowl games in six years and was named National Champion by one organization in 1952.
A second and much rarer version of the title song lyrics also exists. In contrast to the romantic motif of the popular hit tune, the secondary version is instead a paean to the crews who guide the  airliners through the night skies towards distant cities, and concludes with an allusion to the "high and mighty" as the Deity. 
An instrumental version was also recorded in 1954 by the conductor and arranger LeRoy Holmes, reaching #9 on the Billboard chart. It became Holmes' biggest hit, and his most recognizable. The song is known for its distinctive whistling, which accompanies the music, and which was provided by Fred Lowery. (The whistling within the film itself was dubbed by Muzzy Marcellino.) Yet another hit version was recorded by Victor Young and his orchestra in 1954, peaking at #6 on the Billboard chart.
Another vocal version with the complete Ned Washington lyrics has been recorded by Billy Eckstine in his album 12 Great Songs from the movies from the early 1960s. An instrumental version by George Greeley was recorded on his 1959 Warner Bros. album, Greatest Motion Picture Piano Concertos.
The tune is whistled in the fadeout of the Simon & Garfunkel song "Punky's Dilemma", from their 1968 album Bookends. Toward the end of the 1980 film Seems Like Old Times, Chevy Chase's character can be heard whistling the tune as he walks away from the camera.

Jan Heintze (born 17 August 1963) is a retired Danish professional football player, a left-sided defensive midfielder and defender who started and ended his career in the Netherlands with PSV Eindhoven, where he was a part of the PSV team which won the 1988 European Cup. He played 86 matches for the Denmark national football team in the course of 15 years, playing four international tournaments with the team, which he captained in his last two years before he retired in 2003.

==Club career==

Born in Tårnby, he started playing for his hometown club Tårnby Boldklub.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.abtaarnby.dk/40_klubbens-historie.htm | title = Klubbens historie Kendte Tårnby profiler | publisher =  AB Tårnby | accessdate = 15 August 2011 | language = Danish[/tpl] He had a short spell in the youth team of Københavns boldklub (KB) alongside future national team player Michael Laudrup, but Heintze quickly moved on to play for the senior side of Kastrup Boldklub in January 1981, then in the top-flight Danish 1st Division. However, the team was relegated, and though he had offers from foreign clubs, the 17-years-old Heintze stayed at Kastrup, on orders of his mother. 
He was bought by PSV in 1982 as a left winger, in which position he had been most successful in his first years at Kastrup Boldklub. Once at PSV, he was re-schooled as a defender, using his aggressiveness to charge up and down the sideline, and following a first season of few matches, he commanded the left back position in his second year, and made it his own. He won six Dutch Eredivisie league titles and a European Cup with the club, which at times counted three other Danes, Frank Arnesen, Søren Lerby and Ivan Nielsen, before the club hired coach Aad de Mos, who did not want him in the team. Heintze went to Germany to play for Bundesliga relegation battlers Bayer Uerdingen in 1994, and when the team was relegated in 1996, he went on to Bayer Leverkusen under coach Christoph Daum, with whom he finished in the Bundesliga top-three for three years in a row. Heintze returned to finish his career at PSV in 1999, with his old team mate Eric Gerets the head coach. Approaching 40, Heintze was looking to help the young Wilfred Bouma into the team as new left back, while using his experience to provide stability in the defense. He won another three Dutch championship titles before retiring in 2003.

==International career==

Heintze made his Denmark debut on 29 April 1987 in a Euro 1988 qualifying match, a 1–0 win over Finland, and he played all three matches at the final Euro 1988 tournament, though Denmark lost them all. At the final qualification match for the Euro 1992 against Yugoslavia on 1 May 1991, Heintze's then club, PSV, wanted him to stay home to play an important match for PSV, but he decided to travel with the Denmark team, though they were already eliminated from the qualification. Once at the Denmark camp, Heintze learned that national coach Richard Møller Nielsen did not intend to start with him in the game, and after consulting PSV, who still wanted him to play, Heintze decided to go back to the Netherlands, without the knowledge of Møller Nielsen. Back in Eindhoven, Heintze found out he wasn't eligible for the PSV match since he had been written off to play for Denmark. Heintze would see the PSV game from the sideline, and as a punishment for leaving the national team, he received a one-year ban from the national team by Møller Nielsen. As the ban expired before the Euro 1992, Heintze was once more called up, but an injury kept him from re-entering the team. Thus, he missed Denmark's later victory in Euro 1992, following Yugoslavia's exclusion from the tournament due to the Yugoslav wars. He played a further four matches under Møller Nielsen, before his national team career went on hiatus. 
When Denmark hired new coach Bo Johansson in 1996, Heintze was once more called up for Denmark, and he played in the 1998 FIFA World Cup and Euro 2000 tournaments. Following the international retirement of Peter Schmeichel in April 2001, Heintze captained his country at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, under new Denmark coach Morten Olsen. At the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan, Heintze was suffering in the heat, and after being substituted after the second match of the tournament, Heintze watched the last two games from the bench, before Denmark was eliminated. He ended his national career following the competition, 38 years of age, though he continued to play another season for PSV.
In a Euro 2000 qualifying match against Belarus on 5 June 1999 he scored a memorable goal, directly from a corner kick.

[[Cost of carry]]

CATEGORIES: Derivatives (finance), Financial economics, Financial terminology

The cost of carry or carrying charge is the cost of storing a physical commodity, such as grain or metals, over a period of time. The carrying charge includes insurance, storage and interest on the invested funds as well as other incidental costs. In interest rate futures markets, it refers to the differential between the yield on a cash instrument and the cost of the funds necessary to buy the instrument.Managed Futures
Trader Soft
If long, the cost of carry is the cost of interest paid on a margin account.  Conversely, if short, the cost of carry is the cost of paying dividends, or rather the opportunity cost; the cost of purchasing a particular security rather than an alternative. For most investments, the cost of carry generally refers to the risk-free interest rate that could be earned by investing currency in a theoretically safe investment vehicle such as a money market account minus any future cash-flows that are expected from holding an equivalent instrument with the same risk (generally expressed in percentage terms and called the convenience yield). Storage costs (generally expressed as a percentage of the spot price) should be added to the cost of carry for physical commodities such as corn, wheat, or gold.
The cost of carry model expresses the forward price (or, as an approximation, the futures price) as a function of the spot price and the cost of carry.
where
The same model in currency markets is known as interest rate parity.
For example, a US investor buying a Standard and Poor's 500 e-mini futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange could expect the cost of carry to be the prevailing risk-free interest rate (around 5% as of November, 2007) minus the expected dividends that one could earn from buying each of the stocks in the S&P 500 and receiving any dividends that they might pay, since the e-mini futures contract is a proxy for the underlying stocks in the S&P 500.  Since the contract is a futures contract and settles at some forward date, the actual values of the dividends may not yet be known so the cost of carry must be estimated.

David Luke Flatman or 'Flats' (born on 21 January 1980 in Maidstone) is a former rugby player. He was a prop for Bath and the England national rugby union team.  He is now head of communications at Bath rugby.
He started playing rugby union at the age of eight at his local club, Maidstone FC, inspired by his father, who was a prop. A product of Dulwich College, he appeared in the same England Schools (18-group) squad as Steve Borthwick, Andrew Sheridan (also of Dulwich College), Alex Sanderson, Mike Tindall and Jonny Wilkinson.
Flatman toured Australia with England Schools in 1997 and the following year went to Argentina with England Colts. He represented London & South-West and England Under-21s against South Africa in the autumn of 1998.
His senior club rugby began with Saracens in 1998 and he won his first full caps as a replacement in the Tests against South Africa on the summer tour in 2000, when he also appeared in the matches against North-West Leopards and Gauteng Falcons.
He made a second tour with the England side to North America in the summer of 2001, appearing as a replacement for Graham Rowntree in the Burnaby and San Francisco Tests against Canada and the United States respectively. He had a wealth of A team experience having been a regular in the side since making his debut against France in Blagnac in 2000. He had a sequence of seven England A team games before being recalled to the senior squad for the final test of the 2000–1 season against France at Twickenham.
He moved to Bath in 2003, where he proved himself to be one of the finest front row forwards in English rugby union with his sterling performances in a revamped Bath pack.
He would surely have added to his eight caps on England's summer tour of New Zealand and Australia had injury not blighted his efforts.
Flatman announced his retirement from rugby on 15 June 2012. http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/news-comment/david-flatman-over-and-out-7856527.html

[[Microstrip antenna]]

CATEGORIES: Radio frequency antenna types, Microwave technology

In telecommunication, there are several types of microstrip antennas (also known as printed antennas) the most common of which is the microstrip patch antenna or patch antenna.

==Patch antenna==

A patch antenna is a narrowband, wide-beam antenna fabricated by etching the antenna element pattern in metal trace bonded to an insulating dielectric substrate, such as a printed circuit board, with a continuous metal layer bonded to the opposite side of the substrate which forms a ground plane. Common microstrip antenna shapes are square, rectangular, circular and elliptical, but any continuous shape is possible. Some patch antennas do not use a dielectric substrate and instead made of a metal patch mounted above a ground plane using dielectric spacers; the resulting structure is less rugged but has a wider bandwidth.  Because such antennas have a very low profile, are mechanically rugged and can be shaped to conform to the curving skin of a vehicle, they are often mounted on the exterior of aircraft and spacecraft, or are incorporated into mobile radio communications devices.

==Advantages==

Microstrip antennas are relatively inexpensive to manufacture and design because of the simple 2-dimensional physical geometry. They are usually employed at UHF and higher frequencies because the size of the antenna is directly tied to the wavelength at the  resonant frequency.  A single patch antenna provides a maximum directive gain of around 6-9 dBi.   It is relatively easy to print an array of patches on a single (large) substrate using lithographic techniques.  Patch arrays can provide much higher gains than a single patch at little additional cost; matching and phase adjustment can be performed with printed microstrip feed structures, again in the same operations that form the radiating patches.  The ability to create high gain arrays in a low-profile antenna is one reason that patch arrays are common on airplanes and in other military applications.
Such an array of patch antennas is an easy way to make a phased array of antennas with dynamic beamforming ability.[ref]
by Louis E. Frenzel, "Electronic Design" 2008
[/ref]
An advantage inherent to patch antennas is the ability to have polarization diversity.  Patch antennas can easily be designed to have vertical, horizontal, right hand circular (RHCP) or left hand circular (LHCP) polarizations, using multiple feed points, or a single feedpoint with asymmetric patch structures.Bancroft, R. Microstrip and Printed Antenna Design Noble Publishing 2004, chapter 2-3 This unique property allows patch antennas to be used in many types of communications links that may have varied requirements.

==Rectangular patch==

The most commonly employed microstrip antenna is a rectangular patch. The rectangular patch antenna is approximately a one-half wavelength long section of rectangular microstrip transmission line.  When air is the antenna substrate, the length of the rectangular microstrip antenna is approximately one-half of a free-space wavelength. As the antenna is loaded with a dielectric as its substrate, the length of the antenna decreases as the relative dielectric constant of the substrate increases. The resonant length of the antenna is slightly shorter because of the extended electric "fringing fields" which increase the electrical length of the antenna slightly. An early model of the microstrip antenna is a section of microstrip transmission line with equivalent loads on either end to represent the radiation loss.

==Specifications==

The dielectric loading of a microstrip antenna affects both its radiation pattern and impedance bandwidth. As the dielectric constant of the substrate increases, the antenna bandwidth decreases which increases the Q factor of the antenna and therefore decreases the impedance bandwidth. This relationship did not immediately follow when using the transmission line model of the antenna, but is apparent when using the cavity model  which was introduced in the late 1970s by Lo et al.[ref]Lo, Y.T., Solomon D. and
Richards, W.F. "Theory and Experiment on Microstrip Antennas," IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, AP-27, 1979 pp. 137-149.[/ref] The radiation from a rectangular microstrip antenna may be understood as a pair of equivalent slots. These slots act as an array and have the highest directivity when the antenna has an air dielectric and decreases as the antenna is loaded by material with increasing relative dielectric constant.
The half-wave rectangular microstrip antenna has a virtual shorting plane along its center. This may be replaced with a physical shorting plane to create a quarter-wavelength microstrip antenna. This is sometimes called a half-patch. The antenna only has a single radiation edge (equivalent slot) which lowers the directivity/gain of the antenna. The impedance bandwidth is slightly lower than a half-wavelength full patch as the coupling between radiating edges has been eliminated.

==Other types==

Another type of patch antenna is the Planar Inverted-F Antenna (PIFA) common in cellular phones with built-in antennas.(The Planar Inverted-F antenna (PIFA) is increasingly used in the mobile phone market. The antenna is resonant at a quarter-wavelength (thus reducing the required space needed on the phone), and also typically has good SAR properties. This antenna resembles an inverted F, which explains the PIFA name. The Planar Inverted-F Antenna is popular because it has a low profile and an omnidirectional pattern. The PIFA is shown from a side view in Figure 4.[tpl]clarify|date=July 2013[/tpl]) Taga, T. Tsunekawa, K. and Saski, A., "Antennas for  Detachable Mobile Radio Units," Review of the ECL, NTT, Japan, Vol. 35, No.1, January 1987, pp. 59-65.  These antennas are derived from a quarter-wave half-patch antenna.  The shorting plane of the half-patch is reduced in length which decreases the resonance frequency.Inverted-F Antenna (IFA) at antenna-theory.com  Often PIFA antennas have multiple branches to resonate at the various cellular bands.  On some phones, grounded parasitic elements are used to enhance the radiation bandwidth characteristics. 
The Folded Inverted Conformal Antenna (FICA)Di Nallo, C.; Faraone, A., "Multiband internal antenna for mobile phones," Electronics Letters , vol.41, no.9, pp. 514-515, 28 April 2005 has some advantages with respect to the PIFA, because it allows a better volume reuse.

[[Jefferson Market Library]]

The Jefferson Market Branch, New York Public Library, once known as the Jefferson Market Courthouse, is located at 425 Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue), on the southwest corner of West 10th Street, in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, New York City, on a triangular plot formed by Greenwich Avenue and West 10th Street. It was originally built as the Third Judicial District Courthouse from 1874 to 1877, and was designed by architect Frederick Clarke Withers of the firm of Vaux and Withers.
Faced with demolition in 1958, public outcry led to its reuse as a branch of the New York Public Library. The building is now part of the New York City Landmark Preservation Commission's Greenwich Village Historic District, created in 1969.[tpl]cite nycland[/tpl], pp.53-54 The AIA Guide to New York City calls the building "A mock Neuschwansteinian assemblage ... of leaded glass, steeply sloping roofs, gables, pinnacles, Venetian Gothic embellishments, and an intricate tower and clock; one of the City's most remarkable buildings."

==History and architecture==

A tall octagonal wooden fire lookout tower was the first building on the site, built circa 1833, located in the center of the merchants' sheds at the Jefferson Market that had been established at this site in 1832 and named for the late President. Court sessions were held in the Jefferson Assembly Rooms that rose above the market sheds. The wood tower and the market structures were torn down by the city to build a new courthouse, the adjacent Jefferson Market Prison building that stood on the corner of West 10th Street and Greenwich Avenue and new coordinated market housing (built in 1883). Of the carefully massed eclectic and picturesque group, only the former Courthouse now remains.
The commission for the new courthouse went to the firm of Vaux and Withers, but as Calvert Vaux was busy with the American Museum of Natural History and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the design fell to his partner, the English-born Frederick Clarke Withers.[tpl]cite inside[/tpl] pp.135-136  Withers came from the same background as Vaux, so it is not unusual this his High Victorian Gothic design was similar in some respects to the "Ruskinian Gothic" aesthetic of Vaux's early buildings, such as in its polychrome materials – red brick, black stone, white granite, yellow sandstone trim and variegated roof slates.  Reasoning that a building with a clock tower was going to look like a church no matter what he did, Withers decided to add church-like touches with non-religious content, such as the tympanum which shows a scene from The Merchant of Venice instead of the usual scene of Christ sitting in judgment or other ecclesiastical subject matter.  The building also features stained glass windows and a fountain decorated with birds and animals.
The courthouse was completed in 1877, and in 1885 a panel of American architects sponsored by American Architect and Building News voted it the fifth most beautiful building in America.

==Use and reuse==

The building got substantial use as a courthouse, as the Third Judicial District covered the Madison Square area, where the city's entertainment district – The Tenderloin – was located.  So heavy was the traffic, that the country's first night court began there. Among the more noted people arraigned in the courthouse was Harry K. Thaw, the murderer of celebrity architect Stanford White.
The building ceased to be used as a courthouse in 1945;[tpl]cite news |title=To Keep the Best of New York |author=Huxtable, Ada Louise |publisher=New York Times|date=September 10, 1961[/tpl] its future was uncertain, and it was in danger of being torn down.  A group of community preservationists led by Margot Gayle and including E. E. Cummings and Lewis Mumford[tpl]cite aia5[/tpl], p.144 formed the Committee of Neighbors to Get the Clock on Jefferson Market Courthouse Started and campaigned to have the building converted into a library.  In 1961, the New York Public Library agreed to the plan and architect Giorgio Cavaglieri was brought in to restore the exterior and redesign the building's interior for its new use – one of the first adaptive reuse projects in the United States, and a signal event in the historic preservation movement.

The building received further restoration in 1994 by preservationist architect Joseph Pell Lombardi.[tpl]clear left[/tpl]

==Recent history==

In 1996 "Ol' Jeff", the fire bell, silent in the Tower for 135 years, regained its voice with Margot Gayle's help, thanks to Cynthia Crane and Marilyn Dorato.  It strikes the hours from 9am to 9pm.  On April 13, 1997, the New York Times wrote:  "The bell has newly and unexpectedly connected the community surrounding the building on Avenue of the Americas at 10th Street, helping to put the concept of village back in Greenwich Village; it serves as a powerful, an hourly, reminder of the values of architectural preservation."
There are annual tours of the tower, typically on Open House New York day in October.

[[Tailpiece]]

CATEGORIES: String instrument construction

A tailpiece is a component on many stringed musical instruments that anchors one end of the strings, usually the end opposite the end with the tuning mechanism the scroll, headstock, peghead, etc.

==Function and construction==

The tailpiece anchors the strings, so it must be strong enough to withstand their combined tension. Tailpieces of the violin family or viol families of instruments, including double basses, are attached by a "tailgut" looped around the end pin or end button. Originally made of animal gut and adjusted with difficulty by means of a knot, tailguts are now usually made of wire or nylon monofilament, and more easily adjusted with threaded collars, usually made of brass, on the ends.
Tailpieces are made of many materials. Violin tailpieces are typically of wood, usually ebony, rosewood, boxwood, or rarely pernambuco. Other materials include cast light metal, and composites including plastic. Choice of material may have more than just cosmetic effect; a well-made instrument is sensitive to tailpiece weight, mass distribution, and tailgut placement on the saddle. Fretted string instrument tailpieces are typically made of metal. 
Violin tailpieces come in various shapes. Some resemble a tulip or a goblet. The common Hill style has a central longitudinal ridge that gives it a faceted appearance. Some violin tailpieces feature decorative elements, as shell inlays or ornate stylized or figurative carvings.
Devices called "fine-tuners" are sometimes used to assist in the tuning of the instrument; they may either be affixed to the tailpiece or built into its design. Most modern violinists, regardless of what other strings they use, play an E with a solid steel core, which may be overly touchy to tune with the traditional tuning pegs. For convenience in tuning, the added mass of a single fine tuner is a tolerable trade-off. Four fine tuners are advantageous when tuning a set of metal-core strings.
Some electric guitar tailpieces feature a vibrato bar, which a player uses to alter the pitch of all strings at once for various musical effects.

==Setting up tailpieces==

A well-set-up instrument from the violin family will have attention paid to the tuning of the afterlength, or string length on the tailpiece side of the bridge. On many instruments it is set to 1/6 the playing length, or length between nut and bridge, sounding two octaves and a fifth above the open note of the playing length.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.harmonie.net/us/article-cordier-strad/page-deux.html |title=A tail of many parts |author=Laurinel Owen | work=The Strad |date=August 2004 |accessdate=2010-03-28 [/tpl] This tuning may be varied to give certain desired effects.[tpl]cite book |last1=Darnton |first1=Michael |title=The Big Red Book of American Lutherie |type=from 1990 GAL Convention lecture |volume=3 |year=2004 |publisher=Guild of American Luthiers |location=Tacoma |isbn=0-9626447-5-7 |page=366 |chapter=Violin Setups |quote=The shorter the afterlength, the tamer, more refined, more mellow and round the sound will be, but power and freedom of the instrument can suffer.[/tpl]

[[Computerized physician order entry]]

CATEGORIES: Health care, Health informatics, Medical terminology, Medical treatments

Computerized physician order entry (CPOE) (also sometimes referred to as Computerized 'Provider Order Entry'' or ''Computerized Provider Order Management' ) is a process of electronic entry of medical practitioner instructions for the treatment of patients (particularly hospitalized patients) under his or her care. These orders are communicated over a computer network to the medical staff or to the departments (pharmacy, laboratory, or radiology) responsible for fulfilling the order. CPOE decreases delay in order completion, reduces errors related to handwriting or transcription, allows order entry at the point of care or off-site, provides error-checking for duplicate or incorrect doses or tests, and simplifies inventory and posting of charges. CPOE is a form of patient management software.Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (2009). http://healthit.ahrq.gov/images/jan09cpoereport/cpoe_issue_paper.htm

==Terminology related to order entry==

===Filler===

The application responding to, i.e., performing, a request for services (orders) or producing an observation.  The filler can also originate requests for services (new orders), add additional services to existing orders, replace existing orders, put an order on hold, discontinue an order, release a held order, or cancel existing orders.

===Order===

A request for a service from one application to a second application. In some cases an application is allowed to place orders with itself.

===Order detail segment===

One of several segments that can carry order information. Future ancillary specific segments may be defined in subsequent releases of the Standard if they become necessary.

===Placer===

The application or individual originating a request for services (order).

===Placer order group===

A list of associated orders coming from a single location regarding a single patient.

===Order Set===

A grouping of orders used to standardize and expedite the ordering process for a common clinical scenario. (Typically, these orders are started, modified, and stopped by a licensed physician.)

===Protocol===

A grouping of orders used to standardize and automate a clinical process on behalf of a physician. (Typically, these orders are started, modified, and stopped by a nurse, pharmacist, or other licensed health professional.)

==Features of CPOE systems==

Features of the ideal computerized physician order entry system (CPOE) include:

==Patient safety benefits of CPOE==

In the past, physicians have traditionally hand-written or verbally communicated orders for patient care, which are then transcribed by various individuals (such as unit clerks, nurses, and ancillary staff) before being carried out.  Handwritten reports or notes, manual order entry, non-standard abbreviations and poor legibility lead to errors and injuries to patients, according to a 1999 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report.[tpl]cite web | last=Institute of Medicine | first= | year=1999 | url=http://www.iom.edu/Reports/1999/To-Err-is-Human-Building-A-Safer-Health-System.aspx | title=To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System (1999) | publisher=The National Academies Press | accessdate=2012-12-08[/tpl] A follow up IOM report in 2001 advised use of electronic medication ordering, with computer- and internet-based information systems to support clinical decisions.[tpl]cite web | last=Institute of Medicine | first= | year=2001 | url=http://www.nap.edu/books/0309072808/html | title=Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century | publisher=The National Academies Press | accessdate=2006-06-29[/tpl] Prescribing errors are the largest identified source of preventable hospital medical error.

The researchers conducted an analysis over an eight-month period, implementing a CPOE system designed to stop the administration of prophylactic antibacterials. Results showed CPOE significantly improved timely discontinuation of antibacterials from 38.8 percent of surgeries to 55.7 percent in the intervention hospital.http://www.beckersasc.com/asc-quality-infection-control/study-cpoe-systems-improve-prophylactic-antibacterial-use-in-surgical-patients.html CPOE/e-Prescribing systems can provide automatic dosing alerts (for example, letting the user know that the dose is too high and thus dangerous) and interaction checking (for example, telling the user that 2 medicines ordered taken together can cause health problems). In this way, specialists in pharmacy informatics work with the medical and nursing staffs at hospitals to improve the safety and effectiveness of medication use by utilizing CPOE systems.

==Risks of CPOE==

CPOE presents several possible dangers by introducing new types of errors.[tpl]cite journal | author = Ross Koppel, PhD, et al. | year = 2005 | title = Role of Computerized Physician Order Entry Systems in Facilitating Medication Errors | journal = JAMA | volume = 293 | pages = 1197–1203 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/293/10/1197 | accessdate = 2006-06-28 | doi = 10.1001/jama.293.10.1197 | format = abstract | pmid = 15755942 | issue = 10 [/tpl][tpl]cite news  | last = Lohr  | first = Steve  | title = Doctors' Journal Says Computing Is No Panacea  | publisher = The New York Times  | date = 2005-03-09 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/09/technology/09compute.html?ei=5089&en=402b792e748d99a2&ex=1268110800&adxnnl=1&partner=rssyahoo&adxnnlx=1150474153-xVix1BcYkvTKJpuLyHStrQ  | accessdate = 2006-07-15 [/tpl] Prescriber and staff inexperience may cause slower entry of orders at first, use more staff time, and is slower than person-to-person communication in an emergency situation. Physician to nurse communication can worsen if each group works alone at their workstations. Automation causes a false sense of security, a misconception that when technology suggests a course of action, errors are avoided. These factors contributed to an increased mortality rate in the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh's Pediatric ICU when a CPOE systems was introduced.[tpl]cite journal  | author = Yong Y. Han, Joseph A. Carcillo, Shekhar T. Venkataraman, Robert S.B. Clark, R. Scott Watson, Trung C. Nguyen, Hülya Bayir, and Richard A.

==Implementation==

CPOE systems can take years to install and configure. Despite ample evidence of the potential to reduce medication errors, adoption of this technology by doctors and hospitals in the United States has been slowed by resistance to changes in physician's practice patterns, costs and training time involved, and concern with interoperability and compliance with future national standards.[tpl]cite news   | last = Kaufman  | first = Marc  | title = Medication Errors Harming Millions, Report Says.

Retrieved on July 8, 2006 As more hospitals become aware of the financial benefits of CPOE, and more physicians with a familiarity with computers enter practice, increased use of CPOE is predicted. Several high profile failures of CPOE implementation have occurred,[tpl]cite news   | last = Connolly  | first = Ceci | title = Cedars-Sinai Doctors Cling to Pen and Paper  | publisher = The Washington Post  | date = 2005-03-21   | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A52384-2005Mar20.html|accessdate = 2006-08-03 [/tpl] so a major effort must be focused on change management, including restructuring workflows, dealing with physicians' resistance to change, and creating a collaborative environment.
An early success with CPOE by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture or VistA. A graphical user interface known as the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) allows health care providers to review and update a patient’s record at any computer in the VA's over 1,000 healthcare facilities. CPRS includes the ability to place orders by CPOE, including medications, special procedures, x-rays, patient care nursing orders, diets and laboratory tests.
The world's first successful implementation of a CPOE system was at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View, California in the early 1970s. The Medical Information System (MIS) was originally developed by a software and hardware team at Lockheed in Sunnyvale, California, which became the TMIS group at Technicon Instruments Corporation. The MIS system used a light pen to allow physicians and nurses to quickly point and click items to be ordered.
[tpl]As of|2005[/tpl], one of the largest projects for a national EHR is by the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom.  The goal of the NHS is to have 60,000,000 patients with a centralized electronic health record by 2010. The plan involves a gradual roll-out commencing May 2006, providing  general practices in England access to the National Programme for IT (NPfIT). The NHS component, known as the "Connecting for Health Programme",NHS Connecting for Health: Delivering the National Programme for IT Retrieved August 4, 2006 includes office-based CPOE for medication prescribing and test ordering and retrieval, although some concerns have been raised about patient safety features.[tpl]cite journal | author = C J Morris, B S P Savelyich, A J Avery, J A Cantrill and A Sheikh | year = 2005 | title = Patient safety features of clinical computer systems: questionnaire survey of GP views | journal = Quality and Safety in Health Care | volume = 14 | pages = 164–168 | url = http://qhc.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/14/3/164 | accessdate = 2006-07-08 | doi = 10.1136/qshc.2004.011866 | pmid = 15933310 | issue = 3 | pmc = 1744017 [/tpl]
In 2008, the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative and the New England Healthcare Institute (NEHI) published research showing that 1 in 10 patients admitted to a Massachusetts community hospital suffered a preventable medication error. The study argued that Massachusetts hospitals could prevent 55,000 adverse drug events per year and save $170 million annually if they fully implemented CPOE. The findings prompted the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to enact legislation requiring all hospitals to implement CPOE by 2012 as a condition of licensure.http://www.todayshospitalist.com/index.php?b=articles_read&cnt=614Massachusetts Hospitals Must Have CPOE By 2012 And CCHIT-Certified EHRS By 2015: http://www.hl7standards.com/blog/2008/08/13/massachusetts-hospitals-must-have-cpoe-by-2012-and-cchit-certified-ehrs-by-2015/ Retrieved April 11, 2012
In addition, the study[tpl]cite news   | last = Dolan  | first = Pamela L.  | title = Insurer finds EMRs won't pay off for its doctors.  | publisher = American Medical News  | year = 2008  | url = http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2008/03/10/bil20310.htm | accessdate = 2009-10-13 [/tpl] also concludes that it would cost approximately $2.1 million to implement a CPOE system, and a cost of $435,000 to maintain it in the state of Massachusetts while it saves annually about $2.7 million per hospital.  The hospitals will still see payback within 26 months through reducing hospitalizations generated by error.  Despite the advantages and cost savings, the CPOE is still not well adapted by many hospitals in the US.  
The Leapfrog’s 2008 Survey[tpl]cite web  |  publisher = The Leapfrog Group  | year = 2008  | title = Leapfrog Hospital Survey Results.  | url = http://www.leapfroggroup.org/media/file/leapfrogreportfinal.pdf  | format = PDF  | accessdate = 2009-10-13[/tpl] showed that most hospitals are still not complying with having a fully implemented, effective CPOE system.  The CPOE requirement became more challenging to meet in 2008 because the Leapfrog introduced a new requirement: Hospitals must test their CPOE systems with Leapfrog’s CPOE Evaluation Tool.  So the number of hospitals in the survey considered to be fully meeting the standard dropped to 7% in 2008 from 11% the previous year.  Though the adoption rate seems very low in 2008, it is still an improvement from 2002 when only 2% of hospitals met this Leapfrog standard.

[[Reformed Esperanto]]

CATEGORIES: Esperantido, International auxiliary languages

Reformed Esperanto was a reformed version of Esperanto created in 1894.  It is notable as the only complete Esperantido to have been created by Esperanto's original creator, Dr. L. L. Zamenhof. Although Zamenhof's stated preference was to avoid any discussion of changes, he was put under considerable pressure (including financial) to respond to the diverse reforms proposed by others. Reluctantly he decided to present a reformed dialect himself and undertook to continue guiding the community, whether or not reforms were eventually agreed.
Although Zamenhof initially called his reform a systematic attempt to re-create the language in the light of more than six years of practical experience, scarcely any of the Esperanto community of the time accepted it as a whole. The majority voted to reject all changes. Zamenhof himself later rejected the whole project and referred to 1894 as 'a wasted year'. In 1907 he expressly refused permission to anyone wishing to re-publish the proposed reforms. In 1929 Johannes Dietterle cited this refusal as justification for omitting details of the reform project from his collection of Zamenhof's complete works, Originala Verkaro.
Some of the proposed reforms from 1894 such as replacing the -oj plural with -i, the removal of the diacritics and adjectival agreement were used in the language reform project Ido beginning in 1907, but these were not accepted by the Esperanto community either and Esperanto has changed relatively little since the publication of Zamenhof's Fundamento de Esperanto in 1905.

[[The Brandenburgers in Bohemia]]

CATEGORIES: Operas by Bedřich Smetana, Czech-language operas, 1866 operas, Operas

The Brandenburgers in Bohemia ([tpl]lang-cz|Braniboři v Čechách[/tpl]) is a three-act opera, the first by Bedřich Smetana. The Czech libretto was written by Karel Sabina, and is based on events from Czech history. The work was composed in the years 1862–1863. Smetana and Sabina wrote the opera at a time of great Czech patriotism, with the pending opening of a new theatre for production of Czech operas in Prague.  
The opera received its first performance at the Provisional Theater (or the "Interim Theatre"W. W. Cobbett, "Czech National Opera".  The Musical Times, 45(732), pp. 92-95  (February 1, 1904).), Prague, on 5 January 1866, and the first performance was a success.Brian Large, "Smetana's The Secret".  The Musical Times, 113(1551), pp. 452-454 (May 1972).  The first UK performances were in April 1978 by Hammersmith Municipal Opera.Brian Large, "Smetana's Brandenburgers".  The Musical Times, 119(1622), pp. 329-330 (April 1978).

==Roles==

==Synopsis==

Upon the death of King Ottokar II in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld, his widow Kunigunda had called in the Brandenburgian troops to lend aid against the army of victorious Rudolph of Habsburg. Rudolph retired to Austria, nevertheless the Brandenburgers soon acted like occupants: they arrested Kunigunda and her seven-year-old son Wenceslaus at Bezděz Castle and agreed with Rudolph that they would retain the Bohemian rule for the next five years.
The Prague people led by mayor Volfram Olbramovič suffer from the Brandenburg occupation. The citizen Junoš reports on plundering and lootering Brandenburgian troops. Ludiše, the mayor's daughter, rejects the approaches made by the German townsman Jan Tausendmark, who thereupon joins the occupants. The serf Jíra is designated the leader of a rebel movement. He openly charges Tausendmark with the kidnapping of the three daughters of the mayor, Ludiše, Vlčenka and Děčana. To avoid clashes of arms, Olbramovič has Jíra arrested. The mayor's daughters are kept by Brandenburg troops and Olbramovič asks Tausendmark to arrange for their liberation. However, the Brandenburg captain Varnemann demands a high ransom. Meanwhile Jíra is put on trial and condemned to death. However, it is Junoš, in love with Ludiše, who manages to save Jíra. Tausendmark, who intends to abduct Ludiše, fails to reach an agreement with Varnemann. He and the Brandenburgers are driven out of Prague, and the city is liberated.

==Early life==

Born March 11, 1893 in New Ulm, Minnesota,Wanda Gág bio, Minnesota Historical Society. Accessed Apr. 26, 2011. her mother was Elisabeth Biebl Gag and her father was Anton Gag who was an artist and photographer. She was the eldest of seven children most of whom drew, sang, wrote stories and poems.Audur H. Winnan, Wanda Gág, Smithsonian Institute Press, 1993, p. 2 While still a young teen Gág's illustrated story Robby Bobby in Mother Goose Land was  published in The Minneapolis Journal  in their Junior Journal supplement.Richard W. Cox, Minnesota History, Fall 1974, p. 250 When Gág was fifteen her father died of tuberculosis. Her father's final words to her were: "Was der Papa nicht thun konnt', muss die Wanda halt fertig machen." (What Papa couldn't do, Wanda will have to finish.)Gág, p. xxxi Following her father's death, the Gag family was on welfare, and many people suggested that Wanda get a steady job.  She remained in school, however, graduating in June 1912 and then teaching country school in Springfield, Minnesota from November 1912 to June 1913.Winnan, p. 89 In spite of these setbacks, she was determined to become an artist.

==Art school==

From 1913 to 1914, Gág attended The Saint Paul School of Art. From 1914 to 1917 she attended The Minneapolis School of Art under the patronage of Herschel V. Jones.Gág, p. 314  It was there where she met Adolf Dehn who would become her lover for a time and remained a lifelong friend.Wanda Gág Papers, 1892-1968  In 1917, she won a scholarship to the Art Students League of New YorkGág, p.  459 as well as her first book commission, illustrating A Child’s Book of Folk-Lore— Mechanics of Written English by Jean Sherwood Rankin.Gág, p.  466

==New York==

In 1917, Gág moved to Greenwich Village.  At the Art Students League she took classes in composition, etching and advertising illustration. By 1919 she was earning a living as a commercial illustrator. Around this time she added an accent mark in her last name to aid in proper pronunciation (her last name rhymes with "log", not "wag".)Karen Nelson Hoyle Wanda Gág, a Life of Art and Stories pp. 8-10, University of Minnesota Press, 2009  In 1921 she became a partner in a  business venture called "Happiwork Story Boxes", boxes decorated with story panels in the sides. This business, along with other ventures, failed.Hoyle, pp. 10-13 An illustration of Gág's  was published in Broom: An International Magazine of the ArtsHarold A. Loeb, New York, 1921, vol. II, no. 2 in 1921.

In 1927 her article These Modern Women: A Hotbed of Feminists was published in The Nation, drawing the attention of Alfred Stieglitz and prompting Egmont Arens to write: "Be more explicit about your relationships with men. The way you solved that problem seems to me to be the most illuminating part of your career. You have done what all the other 'modern women' are still talking about."Winnan, p. 36, 71L'Enfant, p.130 Gág illustrated the March 1927 cover of the leftist magazine The New Masses.Andrew Hemingway, Artists on the Left: American Artists and the Communist Movement 1926-1956, 2002 Her illustrated story Bunny's Easter Egg was published in John Martin's Book magazine for children in 1927.John Martin's House: New York, vol.

==Books for children==

Gág's work interested Ernestine Evans, director of Coward-McCann's new children's book division. Evans disliked the common children's books of the day, and was looking for new authors and artists to create more realistic, less idealized books. She wanted Gág to illustrate a new edition of an older book, but Gág refused, saying "I am simply not interested in illustration as such... It has to be a story that takes hold of me way down deep".Cech, John (editor), Dictionary of Literary Biographies: American Writers for Children, 1900-1960, Gale Research, 1983, vol. 22, p. 184 Evans asked her to submit her own story with illustrations. Millions of Cats appeared in 1928. It won the Newbery Honor award, a rare achievement for a picture book.[tpl]cite web|title=Newbery Awards|url=http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/newberymedal/newberyhonors/newberymedal|accessdate=2012-05-15[/tpl]  Gág carefully oversaw every aspect of the production of this book. When a second printing was made from inferior copies because the originals had been lost, Gág was unhappy with the results and redrew the missing pieces.Cech, p. 185 There was a movement among educators at the time against fairy tales. Some educators disparaged fairy tales, preferring more realistic literature for children.Hoyle, p. 59 Gág disagreed. "I know I should feel bitterly cheated if, as a child, I had been deprived of all fairy lore..."Cech, p. 187 To encourage the use of these stories, Gág published Tales from Grimm in 1936. Two years later she translated and illustrated Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs as a reaction against the "trivialized, sterilized, and sentimentalized" Disney movie version.Silvey, Anita, The Essential Guide to Children's Books and Their Creators, Houghton Mifflin, 2002, p. 171 Her essay I Like Fairy Tales was published in the March 1939 issue of The Horn Book Magazine.  Nothing at All became a Caldecott Honor book for 1942. More Tales from Grimm appeared posthumously in 1947, four of her translated fairy tales were later released individually with new illustrations by Margot Tomes.

==Family and domestic life==

Gág liked to live and work in the country.  In the early 1920s she would spend her summers drawing at various locations in rural New England, New York and Connecticut. She rented a three acre farm in Glen Gardner New Jersey from 1925 to 1930 ("Tumble Timbers") and purchased a larger farm ("All Creation") in Milford, New Jersey in 1931.Winnan, pp. 71-73 She continued to support some of her adult siblings, some of whom lived with her from time to time. Gág's brother Howard Gág did the hand lettering for her picture books and Wanda also encouraged her sister, Flavia Gág, to write children's books.New Ulm Journal,  July 29, 2010 On August 27, 1943 Gág married her long-time paramour and business manager Earle Humphrey.Winnan, p. 61 Gág developed lung cancer and died in New York City June 27, 1946.

[[Closed-eye hallucination]]

CATEGORIES: Diseases of the eye and adnexa, Symptoms and signs: Cognition, perception, emotional state and behaviour

Closed-eye hallucinations and closed-eye visualizations (CEV) are a distinct class of hallucination.  These types of hallucinations generally only occur when one's eyes are closed or when one is in a darkened room.  They can be a form of phosphene. Certain users report closed-eye hallucinations under the influence of psychedelics. These are reportedly of a different nature than the "open-eye" hallucinations of the same compounds. Closed eye hallucination is directly related to a chronic type.

==Levels of CEV perception==

There are five known levels of CEV perception which can be achieved either through chemical stimuli or through meditative relaxation techniques. Level 1 and 2 are very common and often happen every day. It is still normal to experience level 3, and even level 4, but only a small percentage of the population does this without psychedelic drugs, meditation or extensive visualization training.

===Level 1: Visual noise===

The most basic form of CEV perception that can be immediately experienced in normal waking consciousness involves a seemingly random noise of pointillistic light/dark regions with no apparent shape or order.
This can be seen when the eyes are closed and looking at the back of the eyelids. In a bright room, a dark red can be seen, owing to a small amount of light penetrating the eyelids and taking on the color of the blood within them. In a dark room, blackness can be seen or the object can be more colourful. But in either case it is not a flat unchanging redness/blackness. Instead, if actively observed for a few minutes, one becomes aware of an apparent disorganized motion, a random field of lightness/darkness that overlays the redness/blackness of closed eyelids.
For a person who tries to actively observe this closed-eye perception on a regular basis, there comes a point where if he or she looks at a flat-shaded object with his or her eyes wide open, and tries to actively look for this visual noise, he or she will become aware of it and see the random pointillistic disorganized motion as if it were a translucent overlay on top of what is actually being seen by his or her open eyes.
When seen overlaid onto the physical world, this CEV noise does not obscure physical vision at all, and in fact is hard to notice if the visual field is highly patterned, complex, or in motion. When active observation is stopped, it is not obvious or noticeable, and seemingly disappears from normal physical perception. Individuals suffering from visual snow see similar noise but experience difficulty blocking it from conscious perception.
The noise probably originates from thermal noise exciting the photoreceptor cells in the retina;[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2009[/tpl] compare Eigengrau.

===Level 2: Light/dark flashes===

Some mental control can be exerted over these closed-eye visualizations, but it usually requires a bit of relaxation and concentration to achieve.
[tpl]cite journal|last=Ladd|first=Trumbull|title=Direct control of the retinal field.|journal=Psychological Review|year=1894|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/rev/1/4/351/|accessdate=28 September 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Ladd|first=Trumbull|title=Direct control of the'retinal field': Report on three cases.|journal=Psychological Review|year=1903|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/rev/10/2/139.pdf|accessdate=28 September 2012[/tpl] 
When properly relaxed it is possible to cause regions of intense black, bright white or even colors such as yellow, green, or pink to appear in the noise. These regions can span the entire visual field, but seem to be fleeting in nature.[tpl]cite book | last = Neal | first = Richard McKenzie | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Path to Addiction: And Other Troubles We are Born to Know | publisher = AuthorHouse | year = 2008 | location = | pages = 228–231| url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4389-1674-4 [/tpl]

===Level 3: Patterns, motion, and color===

This level is relatively easily accessible to people who use LSD, and appears to be what most people refer to as colourful visuals.
However, it is also accessible to people involved in deep concentration for long periods of time. When lying down at night and closing the eyes, right before sleep the complex motion of these patterns can become directly visible without any great effort thanks to hypnagogic hallucination.  
The patterns themselves might resemble fractals.

===Level 4: Objects and things===

This is a fairly deep state. At this level, thoughts visually manifest as objects or environments. When this level is reached, the CEV noise seems to calm down and fade away, leaving behind an intense flat ordered blackness. The visual field becomes a sort of active space. A side component of this is the ability to feel motion when the eyes are closed.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]
Opening the eyes returns one to the normal physical world, but still with the CEV object field overlaid onto it and present. In this state it is possible to see things that appear to be physical objects in the open-eye physical world, but that aren't really there.

===Level 5: Overriding physical perception===

If induced by drugs or mental disease, this is the point where it appears to the outside world that a person is either unconscious or insane. The internal CEV perceptions and think-it/feel-it perceptions become stronger than physical perceptions, and completely override and replace open-eye physical perceptions. This can be a potentially dangerous state if a person is still mobile while in a different perceived world, but by this time most people are motionless and not likely to do something hazardous to themselves or others.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
This is the point where most hallucinogenic references say it is a good idea to have a "sitter" present to watch over the person using the chemicals, and keep them from accidentally harming themselves or others while deep into their own world.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2009[/tpl]
This level can be entered from complete sensory deprivation, as experienced in an isolation tank, but even there it requires great relaxation.Lilly, John C. (1990). The Center of the Cyclone.

According to lucid dreaming researcher Stephen LaBerge, perceptions can come from either the senses or imagination. An inhibitory system involving in the thalamus, likely involving serotonergic neurons, inhibits imaginary perceptions from becoming too activated so they turn into hallucinations. This system is inhibited during REM sleep, and the imagination can freely run into the perceptual systems.  What happens at level 5 is likely that this system is inhibited, just like in REM sleep, by different causes like sensory deprivation, psychedelic drugs or meditative relaxation techniques.

==What is not a CEV==

===Image burn-in (afterimage)===

Image burn-in occurs when very bright objects lie in one's field of vision, and should not be confused with closed-eye hallucinations. Visual burn-in from bright lights is visible for a few minutes after closing the eyes, or by blinking repeatedly, but the burn-in effect slowly fades away as the retina recovers, whereas the waking-consciousness CEV noise will not disappear if observed continuously over a period of time.

===Corneal liquid===

CEV does not involve the liquid and air bubbles on the surface of the cornea, which can also be seen by extremely nearsighted people when looking at bright point-light sources with glasses/contacts removed. Also called "Floaters" - often appear as cells floating across the eye. Half-closing and reopening the eyelids creates a very definite wiper-ridge in the corneal liquid that is readily visible. Fully closing and reopening the eyelids also stirs up the corneal liquid which settles down after a brief moment. The motion of waking-consciousness CEV noise is not so directly and physically controllable and repeatable.  This is not necessarily only associated with extreme nearsightedness.

===Blue-sky sprites===

CEV does not seem to be related to the "sprites" (blue field entoptic phenomenon) that can be seen as dots darting around when staring up into a bright blue sky on a sunny day (not looking at the sun). These dots superimposed over a flat blue background are white blood cells moving through the blood vessels of the retina. The motion of waking-consciousness CEV noise is uniformly random compared to the waking-consciousness blue-sky sprite motion.

===Physical retinal stimulation===

CEV is unrelated to the visual noise seen when the retina is physically stimulated.  The retina can be made to produce light patterns of visual noise simply by one rubbing their eyes somewhat forcefully in a manner that increases intraocular pressure.  Additionally retinal noise can be produced by touching near the rear of the eyeball (for example, if one closes their eyes, looks all the way left, and lightly touches the rightmost part of the eye socket, this produces visual noise in the shape of a circle that appears at the left side of the visual field - a practice that is neither painful nor dangerous).  None of these are closed-eye hallucinations.

[tpl]nihongo|Gravion|超重神グラヴィオン|Chōjūshin Guravion|lit. Super Heavyweight God Gravion[/tpl] is an anime television series produced by Gonzo. It aired in Japan from October 7, 2002 to December 16, 2002 and ran for 13 episodes. In 2004, [tpl]nihongo|Gravion Zwei|超重神グラヴィオンZwei|Chōjūshin Guravion Tsuvai|"Zwei" is German for "two"[/tpl] was released and aired from January 8 to March 25 in Japan, running for twelve additional episodes, answering the questions generated from the first series.
Both Gravion and Gravion Zwei are created and directed by Masami Ōbari with mecha designs from Kunio Okawara. Both series were released in the United States by ADV Films.

==Plot==

In Gravion, Eiji Shigure is sent a letter from his missing older sister Ayaka Shigure. His search for her leads him to Klein Sandman, a mysterious billionaire and Eiji secretly infiltrates his enormous Saint-Germain Castle while he is hosting a party for Earth Federation Alliance (EFA) leaders, in order to find her. Unfortunately, he is tricked into piloting the G-Attacker, one of four Gran Divas, in a mission to defeat the mechanical extraterrestrials called the Zeravire. The Gran Divas are machines secretly created by Sandman himself, who states Eiji's unique G-Factor allows him to pilot it. Although reluctant, Eiji becomes part of Sandman's Earthgertz, the planet's only defensive team to prevent the Zeravire from destroying humanity, by combining the Gran Divas with the Gran Kaiser to form the titular mecha, Gravion.
In Gravion Zwei, the Zeravire invasion seems to have stopped. However, when it rises back up all of a sudden, the Earthgertz and its trump card, the super robot Gravion, is needed to defend the Earth again. In the meantime, the EFA creates their own weapons to counter the Zeravire, the Gran Trooper. As they attempt to fend off the Zeravire, the Earthgertz and the EFA must set aside their differences, confront their pasts and unveil the mysteries of the Zeravire, in order to end their impending threat once and for all.

==Characters==

===Eiji Shigure===

Protagonist of the series, 17 year-old Eiji Shigure is searching for his older sister Ayaka Shigure, after he receives a letter from her. Upon finding information she is last seen in service to billionaire Klein Sandman, Eiji enters Sandman's Saint-Germain Castle to find her, but is unknowingly recruited into the Earthgertz as pilot of the Gran Diva, the G-Attacker. He reluctantly stays with the Earthgertz to assume piloting responsibilities, but above all, will leave once he finds Ayaka in Sandman's castle. In Gravion Zwei, he pilots the Geo Mirage.
Easily angered, Eiji carries a short temper and is annoyed by the carefree and clueless Toga, the other boy in the castle, who has no outside interaction prior to Eiji's arrival, or the feisty Luna, who picks on him for not being more like Toga. Regardless, Eiji is reasonable in his rash decisions and develops a close friendship with the rest of his teammates, knowing firsthand how real the Zeravire threat is, thus willing to see the menacing mechanical beings stopped by helping the Earthgertz in their mission. [tpl]Voiced by|Kenichi Suzumura|Chris Patton[/tpl]

===Luna Gusuku===

An energetic, friendly 14 year-old girl, Luna Gusuku teases Eiji for her amusement and befuddles him for not being as straight and decent like Touga. One of two pilots of the G-Driller Gran Diva and born in Okinawa, she came to Klein Sandman's castle at a young age, meeting Toga Tenkuuji first. Her father Isana Gusuku disappears while working for the billionaire, and has since stayed in Sandman's castle, eventually enrolling into the Earthgertz. In Gravion Zwei, she pilots the Geo Javelin. [tpl]Voiced by|Haruna Ikezawa|Luci Christian[/tpl]

===Touga Tenkuuji===

The only other boy in Klein Sandman's castle, 17 year-old Touga Tenkuuji is a very kind and gentle person with a smile almost always on his face. Toga claims he has been inside the castle all his life, never knowing any other human interaction besides the Earthgertz and Sandman's countless maids. Extremely athletic and physically strong, he is the pilot of the Gran Kaiser, the robot that combines with the four Gran Divas to form the Gravion.
Touga has one of the highest G-Factors among the Earthgertz, thus is capable of withstanding the pressures of piloting the Gran Kaiser. It is Sandman's wish that Touga's interaction with Eiji Shigure will help him develop his human side, and though Toga learns more of the environment outside the castle, his views are simplistic and childish in nature, such as putting victory over the Zeravire first above conserving human life, something which Eiji does not approve Touga of.
Originally an orphan, Touga was raised at an orphanage sponsored by Sandman. Frequently bullied by some of the other children, another orphan was there to help him through his time at the orphanage, until Sandman adopted him and took him to Saint-Germain Castle. [tpl]Voiced by|Jun Fukuyama|Greg Ayres[/tpl]

===Eina===

One of the many maids working in Klein Sandman's castle, Eina treats all members of Earthgertz and the other maids well. Easily frightened, Eina finds simple arguments harsh and battles against the Zeravire to be unbearable, but does her best in her piloting duties as the second driver of the G-Driller. She has cared and looked after Touga Tenkuuji since his arrival into Klein Sandman's Saint-Germain Castle. In Gravion Zwei, she pilots the Geo Javelin alongside Luna Gusuku.
In Gravion Zwei, Eina reveals herself as one of Sandman's Proto Gran Divas. It took Sandman nearly 50 years to create her current, artificial body. After she is destroyed following a Zeravire attack, her memories are immediately transferred to her original body, located inside the Sol Σ Gravion, stored on the moon. [tpl]Voiced by|Mai Nakahara|Jessica Boone[/tpl]

===Mizuki Tachibana===

The only female adult member of Earthgertz, the busty Mizuki Tachibana is the pilot of the Gran Diva, the G-Striker, who loves her alcohol, but is also the most rational member among her teammates. A skilled hacker, she looks up to Ayaka Shigure when she first arrived at Klein Sandman's castle and claims Ayaka as her best friend, though is still in question at her sudden disappearance. In Gravion Zwei, she pilots the Geo Stinger.
Her name is actually an alias; in Gravion Zwei, she reveals herself as a sleeper agent, working for the EFA intelligence division. Upon stealing development data on the Gravion, she returns to her superiors, in order to provide them the means to counter the Zeravire threat. For her services, she is given a lush, island estate, but returns to the Earthgertz shortly, citing boredom as her primary reason. [tpl]Voiced by|Yu Asakawa|Kira Vincent-Davis[/tpl]

===Leele===

A shy girl who lives isolated within the castle's south tower, Leele claims her parents died in a fire years ago. She has no memories following the accident, which has left her traumatized and the sight of raging blue flames easily puts Leele into an extremely frightened state. Raised by Klein Sandman, she secludes herself from others, but opens up to her fellow Earthgertz teammates when they realize she is the pilot of the G-Shadow Gran Diva. Leele is occasionally seen with her pet ferret Lolotte. In Gravion Zwei, she pilots the Geo Caliber.
Leele's full name is Leele Zeravire, the daughter of Zieg Zeravire and Lufira Zeravire. Before her home planet of Llambias was destroyed, thus the origin of her lost memories, she was placed in a stasis capsule and sent by her uncle Hugi Zeraire into space, following the signal of her father's vessel. Her escape ship failed to enter warp travel, thus arrived on Earth at a later time, yet her own subjective time was different, thus she only aged a few months. Sandman finds her and takes her into Saint-Germain Castle. [tpl]Voiced by|Houko Kuwashima|Allison Keith[/tpl]

===Raven===

An enigmatic, masked man who works for Klein Sandman, Raven is completely loyal to his master, never sharing any personal information about himself. Raven oversees the Earthgertz's training, combat simulations and attack situations against the Zeravire, and occasionally answers to the EFA about Sandman's involvement in the extraterrestrials' invasion, in place of Sandman himself.
In Gravion Zwei, it is revealed the current Raven is actually Ayaka Shigure, Eiji Shigure's sister. The mask holds the memories of the original Raven, a former colleague of Zieg Zeravire on his homeworld of Llambias. The previous holder of Raven's mask was Luna Gusuku's father Isana, before he passed it down to Ayaka. [tpl]Voiced by|Hikaru Midorikawa|Vic Mignogna[/tpl]

===Klein Sandman===

The handsome, billionaire businessman and commander of the Earthgertz, Klein Sandman's knowledge of science and technology allows him to build the Gran Divas and the Gran Kaiser to battle the Zeravire. Sandman selects people with a high tolerance on the effects of gravity, a genetically inherited trait he calls the G-Factor, to become the pilots of his machines. When it seems the Zeravire are too much to handle for Earthgertz, Sandman approves of combining the Gran Divas and the Gran Kaiser into Gravion. In Gravion Zwei, he pilots the Gran Sigma.
Sandman was originally Zieg Zeravire, a scientist from the ecologically devastated planet of Llambias and the husband to Lufira Zeravire. In order to stop further contamination and to prevent an all-out war between the neighboring world of Selias, due to Llambians forcing themselves to immigrate there, Sandman creates the Genesis Machine Gran Sigma, the prototype to the Gran Kaiser, in hopes of restoring Llambias' environment. Unfortunately, his brother-in-law Hugi Zeravire creates the Genocidron System, an automatic, robotic network programmed for extermination. He intended to use it on the Selians, as a means to spare enough Llambians if war was to occur, but Sandman did not wish to see lives sacrificed. Following a brief struggle with Hugi, he accidentally destroys the control device to the Genocidron System, making the machines indiscriminately destroying both worlds.
Upon escaping Llambias, Sandman and Raven flee to Earth. In order to conceal his identity, he takes the name and appearance of the actual Klein Sandman, an 18th-century aristocrat.  To provide himself the means to prepare for the Zeravire, Sandman genetically suppresses his own G-Factor, giving him immortality and turning his hair purple from its original blond.  Some time before Eiji's arrival at Saint-Germain Castle, a spacecraft lands on Earth that followed his escaping vessel, carrying his daughter, Leele Zeravire. Sandman never knew of her survival until then.
Klein Sandman makes an appearance in Juusou Kikou Dancouga Nova, which is also directed by Masami Obari. [tpl]Voiced by|Sho Hayami|Jason Douglas[/tpl]

===Faye Xin Lu===

Appearing in Gravion Zwei, Faye Xin Lu is captain of the G-Soldiers squadron in the EFA military. Very serious and committed to her line of duty, she was an orphan at the same orphanage sponsored by Sandman, meeting Toga Tenkuji for the first time, protecting him from frequent bullies. In fact, Faye was initially selected to be trained as the pilot of the Gran Kaiser, for she had a similar, if not, higher G-Factor than Toga, but Sandman made a last-minute decision and selected him, instead.  This last-minute switch leaves Faye feeling embittered towards both Toga and Sandman, causing her to attempt to surpass Toga and even at one point take advantage of his fragile mental state.  However, upon being saved by Sol Gravion, she reconsiders and dismisses her grudge.  She pilots Grantrooper Unit 1, armed with the Graviton Rang weapon based on God Gravion's Graviton Crescent.  It can also draw energy from the other four units for its Graviton Lightning Detonator, based on the Graviton Arc. [tpl]Voiced by|Saeko Chiba|Stephanie Nadolny[/tpl]

==Mecha==

===God Gravion===

The main mecha of the series used by the Earthgertz as the last line of Defense from the Zeravire invasion. God Gravion heavily resembles Flame Breaster Fighbird  from The Brave Fighter of Sun Fighbird, an earlier work from Kunio Okawara. The mech is composed of five units:

====Gran Kaiser====

Core unit of the Gravion and piloted by Toga Tenkuji, the Gran Kaiser is a humanoid robot. Built upon the power of gravity, the Gran Kaiser is capable of entering Elgo Form, where its power is magnified significantly, strengthening its attacks. However, placing the Gran Kaiser in this configuration places a high degree of physical stress on the pilot, thus, only a well-trained individual with a high G-Factor can effectively use the machine to its fullest.  The Gran Kaiser is essentially a duplicate of the original Gran Sigma created by Sandman as a genesis machine, completed and modified for a greater focus on combat. The two machines are thus capable of utilizing almost all of the same equipment, with any performance difference between the two being inappreciable.
The Gran Kaiser can also utilize separate weapons independent of itself, such as mecha-sized handguns, rocket launchers and a Gatling gun. When combined into the God Gravion with the four Gran Divas, the Gran Kaiser can unleash a wave of pure gravity energy from its forehead jewel called the Graviton Arc. The God Gravion also used an experimental sword called the Graviton Breaker for the first and only time in the first series, until Klein Sandman summons the Chōjū Ken, a powerful two-handed sword kept hidden on the moon for the God Gravion. Also known as the White Steel Fang, the machine is capable of performing the [tpl]nihongo|Super Heavyweight Slash|超重斬|Chōjū Zan[/tpl] technique. Much like God Gravion resembling Flame Breaster Fighbird, Gran Kaiser resembles Fighbird's regular form.

====G-Attacker====

Representing Gravion's right leg, the fighter jet-like G-Attacker is piloted by Eiji Shigure (his sister, Ayaka, was the original pilot until her disappearance) and the counterpart to the G-Striker. There is no externally visible difference between it and the G-Striker, but their internal payload differs. The G-Attacker is fitted with payloads of gravity-powered Graviton Missiles.

====G-Striker====

Representing Gravion's left leg, the fighter jet-like G-Striker is piloted by Mizuki Tachibana and the counterpart to the G-Attacker. This unit holds compartments for the Graviton Rifle and the whip-based Graviton Viper,  but can also fire rounds of the Graviton Vulcan and Graviton Laser.  The G-Striker and G-Attacker can combine side-by-side by folding up one wing, and are capable of underwater movement, but this combination and ability is seen only briefly.

====G-Driller====

The only two seater Gran Diva, the G-Driller mounts a pair of powerful drills and cannons and acts as the God Gravion's arms, with Luna Gusuku piloting the left and Ena piloting the right. With the G-Driller Gran Diva, Gravion can utilize the Graviton Buster, firing short bursts of gravity energy or launch one half of the G-Driller from its arms as the Graviton Pressure Punch or both of them as the Double Pressure Punch and the Graviton Tornado Punch, where the G-Driller configures to its drill mode, then fired like the Pressure Punch. The Pile Tornado Punch is used with both of the arms in drill mode, with the second one boosting the first.  On its own, the G-Driller can split into its two halves to function independently, or act as large roller skates for the Gran Kaiser.  The G-Driller's drills are also capable of converting into large propellers for underwater movement, and in this mode can deploy handles for the Gran Kaiser to hold onto.

====G-Shadow====

A special jet shaped like a stealth bomber, it unloads multiple warheads from a high altitude for invisible runs, akin to the actual B-2 Spirit. Leele is the G-Shadow's pilot, and when combined into the God Gravion, its wings can detach, forming a boomerang. Powered by gravity energy, the boomerang slices through Zeravire armor as the Graviton Crescent. The jewel crest on the G-Shadow can also detach as a sword hilt and handle for use as the Graviton Sword, where the blade energizes into metal from gravity energy.  The G-Shadow can also transform into a submarine-like configuration wherein the wings fold and a propeller is deployed from the underside, or dock with the G-Driller with one half attached to either side of the main body.  The latter combination is often utilized for oversea battles or if Leele is incapacitated, allowing Luna and Ena to use the G-Shadow's weapons without her.

====Gran Fortress====

If there is ever a need to deliver the Gran Kaiser and the Gran Divas away from Saint-Germain Castle, the Gran Fortress battleship is fitted to hold and support the units, taking the Earthgertz directly into an encounter with the Zeravire.  In addition to serving as a transport for each of the Gran Divas, the Gran Fortress can also serve as a riding platform for the combined God Gravion, allowing the unit to launch and transport to the combat zone without needing to perform the lengthy combination during combat or provide it with additional speed and flight capability during battle.  It is unseen if the Gran Fortress can serve this purpose for the other iterations of Gravion as well.

===Sol Gravion/Sol Σ Gravion===

Appearing in Gravion Zwei, this is the upgrade to Gravion, where the Gran Kaiser combines with the upgraded Gran Divas:

====Geo Javelin====

Replacing the G-Driller, it is the only two seater of the new Gran Divas, the Geo Javelin mounts one drill in the front and a cannon on top of it, and acts as the arms of Sol Gravion, and Sol Σ Gravion, with Luna piloting the left and Eina piloting the right. With the Geo Javelin Gran Diva, Sol Gravion can launch the left arm for the Sol Graviton Pressure Punch or both of them for the Sol Graviton Spiral Crusher Punch in which Sol Gravion connects both of its hands together and then launches them at the enemy as they spin around in a drill-like motion, and can use Graviton energy to extend the drill for the Sol Graviton Breaker

====Geo Stinger====

Replacing the G-Fighter, it is piloted by Mizuki, and represents the left leg of Sol Gravion and Sol Σ Gravion. It is not shown to have compartments for the Graviton Viper or the Graviton Rifle, but it has been shown to be able to use the Graviton Lasers.

====Geo Caliber====

Replacing the G-Attacker, it is piloted by Leele, and represents the right leg of Sol Gravion and Sol Σ Gravion. Like the G-Attacker before it, it can use Graviton Missiles.

====Geo Mirage====

Replacement for the G-Shadow, and piloted by Eiji. With the Geo Mirage's cannons, Sol Gravion can use the Sol Graviton Cannon or the stronger Sol Graviton Nova which is used like the Graviton Arc, but generates more power from the cannons. It can summon the Chōjū Ken in the same fashion as the Graviton Sword, as it seems the Chōjū Ken was originally being summoned from Sol Gravion's chestplate.
These new Gran Divas, originally stored on the moon, can also merge to form the battleship G-Gradius.  This configuration can be used as a riding platform by the Gran Kaiser in much the same method that the Gran Fortress was used by God Gravion.  Klein Sandman's personal unit, the Gran Sigma, is also capable of combining with the new Grand Divas to form the Sol Σ Gravion, and it is originally delivered in this configuration, piloted at first by Ena and then by Eiji.  Unlike God Gravion, Sol Gravion utilizes a connection with the user's mind to create increased energy based on their emotions.  The Sol Flames it produces as a result can fuel its enormous destructive potential or provide it with equal creative potential, enabling it to use Ena's love for her companions to restore the beaten God Gravion and Grantroopers to full strength.

===God Σ Gravion===

Using another set of Gran Divas specifically meant for the Gran Sigma, Klein Sandman combines them with his personal unit to form the God Σ Gravion. Appearing in Gravion Zwei, its design and weaponry are different from the original God Gravion, but shares many similarities, with the added Graviton Lancer that can execute the Graviton Break attack, stored in the remodeled G-Striker.  The Graviton Lancer was seen briefly in the finale of Gravion as one of the weapons under consideration for construction as a last-ditch addition to God Gravion. God Σ Gravion heavily resembles Thunder Baron from The Brave Fighter of Sun Fighbird, an earlier work from Kunio Okawara.

===Ultimate Gravion===

Upon fusing the Sol Gravion and Σ Gravion, the Ultimate Gravion is born. Appearing in Gravion Zwei, this machine boasts the greatest power out of all the Earthgertz's machines. Its main weapon is the [tpl]nihongo|Super Heavyweight Judgment Sword|超重弾劾剣|Chōjū Dangai Ken[/tpl] (Revealed in the Pachislot Game version of the series) which uses to execute its most powerful attack, the [tpl]nihongo|Super Heavyweight Flame Emperor Slash|超重炎皇斬|Chōjū En'ō Zan[/tpl]. Its combination sequence and final attack are similar to those of Great Fighbird.

===Gran Troopers===

Also called G-Soldiers, these transformable, non-combining mass production units are modeled after the Gran Kaiser by the EFA military. Five units are assigned to the military's G-Soldiers. Each unit is designed to replicate a different one of the Gran Kaiser's weapon systems. Faye Xin Lu uses the first G-Trooper in Gravion Zwei, with the Graviton Arrow mounted on its forearms which can combine into a single bow weapon or be thrown as a boomerang, replicating the Graviton Crescent attack (though the attack is dubbed "Graviton Rang" by Faye).  The five G-Troopers can also share their energy with Faye's unit to allow it to use the chest-mounted Lightning Detonator finisher.  While initially successful against the Zeravire, the G-Troopers prove insufficient to combat the stronger and more numerous Zeravire that appear near the series' end.

==Zeravire==

The main antagonists of the series, all of them are part of the Genocydrone system made by Hugi Zeravire.  The Zeravire are designed to exterminate all life on a planet, adapting their technology as needed if they encounter resistance, in order to allow Goma to engulf the planet and completely remake it into a primordial state, allowing new life to flourish.  Destroyed Zeravire rapidly biodegrade so that they will provide nutrients for the newly recreated world.  All of the Zeravire have a special segment of their programming which prohibits them from knowingly causing any harm to Leele Zeravire, and forces them to freeze or self-destruct if they attempt to do so.

===Types===

Appears in episode 1.
Larger variation of the warrior class, appears in episode 2.
Appears in episode 3.
Appears in episode 4.
Appears in episode 5.
Designed for reconnaissance, appears in episode 6.
Appears in episode 7.
Appears in episode 8 in three different variations.
Kamikaze variation, appears in episode 10.  Its body charges up a large beta ray pulse which would irradiate everything within a mile's radius, and uses tentacles to defend and shield itself in the meantime.  One such tentacle captures Cecile, one of the castle's maids, creating a point of friction between Toga and Eiji over Toga's willingness to sacrifice her to defeat the Zeravire, but she is ultimately rescued and the Neutron Bomb Zeravire defeated by the Graviton Crescent.
Appears in episodes 11 and 12.
Appears in episode 13 and acts as the final boss of the first series.  It was specifically designed to counter all of God Gravion's weapons.  It has two forms, the first featuring an enormous lower body resembling a large brick, which it uses to crush the EFA's newest anti-Zeravire machine in one blow.  This form is defeated by the G-Breaker, causing it to reveal its lighter second form.  This form is primarily armed with a large chainsaw-like blade, which allows it to destroy the G-Breaker along with all of Gravion's other weapons before it is finally defeated by the Choju Ken.

===Gravion Zwei===

Is essentially a warrior class variation, appears in episode 1.
Capable of surviving in lava, appears in episode 3.  It draws energy from a volcano located near a hot springs resort the team was staying at, forcing God Gravion to drag it out of the volcano and destroy it with the Choju Zan.
A warrior class variation that can survive underwater, appears in episode 4.  Its body is armed with multiple tentacles with which it can attack.  It drains power from a geothermal plant on the ocean's floor to fully mature, then attempts to challenge Gravion.  With Toga having been temporarily blinded through oxygen deprivation, the Clione Zeravire initially gains the upper hand until Leele guides his Choju Zan attack against it.
Smaller variations of soldier class used to assist Clione Zeravire, appear in episode 4.
Appears in episode 5.  It absorbed the entire Grand Island amusement park and the island it was located on, attempting to target the Gravion pilots at first with human-scaled Zeravire soldiers and then a larger form made from a ferris wheel before revealing its true scale.  It was the largest Zeravire encountered on Earth, and easily defeated God Gravion until it recognized Leele, forcing it to self-destruct.
One of the early versions of the Zeravire, appear in episode 6.
Early versions of the warrior class, appear in episode 6.
Transformable version of Egg Zeravire, appears in episode 7.  It combines with the Gran Kaiser during its moment of vulnerability during combination, turning its body red and forcing it to use Graviton Arc repeatedly against the others.  It is damaged and forced to separate by a suicide attack from Ena, but recombines into a Gravion-like form and attacks before being destroyed by the Grantroopers.
Appear in episode 8.  It is destroyed by the Grantroopers, though its destruction releases a large amount of anti-graviton particles that are used to assist Gate Zeravire.
Appears in episode 9.  The lower half of its body forms a large open triangle which creates a spatial distortion, allowing it to create a gate through which enormous amounts of Zeravire can be summoned.  IT initially overwhelms the Grantroopers and God Gravion, but is destroyed by the combined efforts of God Gravion and Sol Sigma Gravion.
Appears in episode 9.  Its body splits open to form an iron maiden-like device which impales and crushes its victim within.  It manages to defeat God Gravion, but is destroyed in one attack by the arriving Sol Sigma Gravion.
Three hologram-like zeravire used as field commanders, appear in episodes 10 and 11.  Holograms of them are destroyed by Sol Gravion's Sol Graviton Nova, while the real things are deployed to defend Goma, only to be defeated by the Grantroopers and God Sigma Gravion.
A zeravire specifically designed to counter Sol Gravion, appears in episode 12.  Its body was created using the condensed energy from both Llambias and Selias.
The source of all Zeravire, appears throughout series although it's true form is revealed in episode 12.  Goma is a large-scale genesis machine much like Gran Sigma, but founded on the idea that creation cannot exist without destruction, it must destroy a planet in order to create a new one.  It normally takes a sphere-like form, but can open into an enormous robotic form.  It attempts to ram itself into Earth in robot form, only to be destroyed by Ultimate Gravion.

[[Ayya Vaikundar]]

CATEGORIES: Ayya Vaikundar, Ayyavazhi, Indian saints, People considered avatars by their followers, 1810 births, 1851 deaths

Ayya Vaikundar ([tpl]lang-ta|அய்யா வைகுண்டர்[/tpl]), according to Akilattirattu Ammanai (or Akilam), a scripture of the Ayyavazhi, was a Manu (father, sovereign) Avatar of Narayana,  incarnated as Ayya Vaikundar. In order to get the physical human nature, Lord narayana used the body of Mudisoodum Perumal. (also called as Sampooranathevan) (c. 1810 – c. 1851).Akilathirattu Ammanai, Akilam nine, verse 431-438 Narayana ordering two celestial saints to bring the body of Mudisoodum Perumal for the incarnation of Vaikundar 
deva (a deity).N.Vivekananthan's Akilathirattu Ammanai, Moolamum Uraiyum Pakam Ontu, Chapter 8, page-414, line 17-20 Birth of Sampooranathevan 
The exact date of birth of Mudisoodum Perumal is unknown. It is mostly placed in either 1810 or 1809,V.T.Chellam's, Thamizaka Varalarum Panpadum Chapter 12, Page 493, (foot note) "The researcher's views and my earlier views as 1803 should be corrected as 1810." while others follow the view of Akilam.R.Ponnu's Vaikuntacuvamikal Valvum Valikattalum, 1983, page-38M.S.S.Pandiyan's, Meanings of Colonialism and Nationalism: An essay on Vaikunda Swamy Cult, Studies in History, Vol. VIII 1992 page 177A.Sreedhara Menon's A Survey of Kerala History, Madras 1996 (Revised Edition), Page 400Arunan's Tamilakatil Camuka Cirtirutam Irunuttantu Varalaru, Madurai: Vaihai Publications, 1999, page-28

==Birth of body and spirit==

In 1809 a child was born to the couple  Narayanam and Mahalekshmi  in south India, at Swamithoppe in the Kanyakumari District (part of Travancore then). They initially named the child Vaikundam, meaning "Lord Narayanam with a crown"
The religious book, Akilam, tells of a legend of a child who was born dead, and then the soul of the deva  Sampooranathevan was placed in the body. According to the legend, the parents found the child still for a time immediately after birth, then the child began to behave normally. Thereafter, that boy grew up called Muthukutty in human history, and Sampooranathevan in Ayyavazhi mythology.
Muthukutty, a religious boy, had special interest in the worship of Vishnu. The holy book Akilam mentions that he had set a pedestal for Lord Vishnu in his house and worshipped the deity devoutly.Akilattirattu Ammanai Published by T. Palramachandran Nadar, Star Press:Suchindram, 9th impression, 1989, page 197 At the age of seventeen, Muthukutty married Thirumalammal from the nearby village of Puviyur, and started a family with her. However, some believe that they were not married at all, but that, she had come to live with him only to serve him during his public activities.G.Patrick's Religion and Subalter Agency, Chapter 4, Page 86 Thirumalammal had been previously married, but left her former husband to marry Muthukutty.N.Vivekananthan's, Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum Pakam Ontu, Chapter 8, Page 398, Line 22: Birth of Parathevathai According to quotes found in Akilam, they had a male child, who was sired by her first husband. Muthukutty earned his living as a Palmyra palm climber and as an agricultural laborer.G,Patrick's Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 4, Page78

==The transformation==

In his twenty-fourth year, Muthukutty was struck by a severe illness and suffered for a year. His mother took her sick son to the temple at Thiruchendur, during a festival in Thiruchendur. There, Muthukutty went into the sea and disappeared. The parents searched for his body for a whole day. According to legends, on the third day,  Lord Vishnu ( Ayya Vaikundar) appeared on the sea-shore. On seeing him, Muthukutty or Samboornadevan's mother mistook him for her son and tried to embrace him. But the god (Ayya Vaikundar) told her that he was no longer her son, but the son of Narayana.M.S.S.Pandiyan, Meanings of Colonialism and Nationalism, Page-177: "Vishnu had given him a rebirth as his son."   Then he started walking towards Detchanam. This place became a holy place for the devotees of Ayyavazhi and they erected a temple there named Avatharappathi at Thiruchendur. This event is celebrated during the festival of Ayya vaikundar avataram.

==The incarnation of Ayya Vaikundar==

Ayya Vaikundar, who arose from the sea at Thiruchendur (As per Akilathirattu Ammanai) on 20th of the Tamil Month of Masi, (March 4, 1833 C.E; '3/4/1833') is considered a unique Avatar by the followers of Ayyavazhi. Akilam, speaks about it in great detail, as summarized below: 
 
 In each of the five yugas prior to the transformation of Ayya Vaikundar, as each fragment of Kroni (evil or Devil) came into physical form, the Lord Vishnu incarnated as well, destroying them. However, in this the sixth yuga, the evil was called Kali, (not the Hindu deity)G.Patrick's, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Appendix, A Sequential Narration of The Salient Episodes From the Mythography of Ayyavali, Page-206 and having no physical form (see Pre-Incarnational Events for this account) he occupied the mind of people of earth as the Mayai (illusion), causing them to behave discourteously.  Kaliyan claimed, it was impossible to destroy him in this yuga as in the previous ones as he held the boon from gods, it was impossible for Narayan, or any others, to incarnate in the world to destroy him. 
Since God could not incarnate directly, He incarnated as Ayya Vaikundar in three stages. 
According to Akilam Ayya Vaikundar was not merely a human, not merely Narayana, and not merely the Ultimate Soul, but on the other hand he was a human and he was the Ultimate Soul and he was Narayana. He was the one who had the responsibility to destroy the evil of Kali.
There is another view that Vaikundar did not take a human body and showed only a bodily appearanceThechanathu Thuvarakapathi Akilathirattu Akakorvai published by Thechanathu Thuvarakapathi, page 37 to mankind based upon some quotes in akilam.N.Vivekanandan's Akilattirattu Ammanai moolamum uraiyum, Pakam 2 Chapter 11, page 112, lines 34,35.

==Tavam==

Having reached Poovantanthoppe, (present-day Swamithope), he undertook to perform a penance. The penance consisted of three stages, each spanning two years. There is a tradition that describes his postures during the six-year tavam as follows: during the first two years, he stood inside a pit of six depth, during the next two years, squatted on the ground, and, during last two years, sat on a raised platform. His appearance was squalid, "long and entangled plait of hair" and frayed clothes. He spoke less and subsisted on frugal meals.G.Patrick's, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 4, Page 79:He seems to have spoken less and subsisted on frugal meals.

==Incinerating evil spirits==

Akilattirattu speaks of this act of incinerating the evil spirits as an important event in the incarnation of Ayya Vaikundar. It took place when he was performing his great penance, which had been announced by him to be the means of destroying the kalimayai - the illusory evil force.G.Patrick's, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 4, Page-80  He, then, gathered the people around, and caused some of them, both male and female, to get possessed of the evil spirits (peyattam).G.Patrick's Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 4, Page 80 The possessed ones came and danced in front of the crowd as if the evil spirits had come upon them. Vaikundar, then, ordered these evil spirits to make an oath, in front of the people, to surrender their powers and get burned up in flames. When he had finished his orders, those dancing under the duress of possession got exhausted and fell flat on the ground. Thus the evil spirits were incinerated.Akilattirattu Ammanai published by T. Palaramachandar Nadar, Star Press: Suchindrum, 9th impression, 1989, page 254-260

==Seizing the powers of witchcraft, sorcery, and other esoteric magical practices==

Similarly, Vaikundar performed another action to 'seize the esoteric evil powers'. Akilam says that, he took away the powers of those who knew to perform witchcraft, sorcery, and other magical rituals. People living in the hills, called as Kanikkarar, were believed to be powerful shamans or witchdoctors, having powers to contain or to provoke the demons. Vaikundar, in a trance, made some of these Kanikkarar to testify in front of the people that they had surrendered their powers. People grew appreciative of Ayya's actions. They began addressing him as Vaikuntacami. This implied an attribution of divinity to Vaikundar.G.Ptrick's, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 4, Page 80   Vaikundar exhorted the people as follows:
''"There are no demons, no devils,
No ill effects of magical practices,
No disease, no pain, and no extortion of taxes,
And, therefore, live courageously."''

==Vaikundar as Pantaram==

The fame of Vaikundar had begun to spread in the countries of Travancore and Tirunelveli, and he had been gradually recognised socially as a religious person with extraordinary powers.G.Patrick's, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 4, Page 81 In the religious parlance of the time, he was addressed as a Pantaram, a religious person hailing from, and serving the ordinary folk. Akilattirattu addresses him as NarayanaPantaram.Akilattirattu Ammanai Published by T.Palaramachandarn Nadar, 9th impression, 1989, Page 253. 
People came to him to listen to his teachings and instructions, to be cured by him of different diseases, to witness, worship and serve a religious person. Vaikundar encouraged the people to come together around a well to take a ritual bath, irrespective of caste differences. He encouraged them to dine together in his presence.Akilattirattu Ammanai Published by T. Palaramachandarn Nadar, 9th impression, 1989, Page 251.
He gave out a number of teachings and instructions, the central point of which was that he had come to abolish Kali Yukam, and to usher in an age of Dharma Yukam, during the time of which the now-oppressed and suffering people would be liberated and rule the land under his leadership. 'Uplift of the lowly is dharmam’Akilattirattu Ammanai Published by T. Palaramachandarn Nadar, 9th impression, 1989, Page 212. was a constant refrain in his teachings.G.Patrick's, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 4, Page-81 People were encouraged to serve as catalysts for the destruction of Kali by transforming themselves to be 'people of Dharma Yukam' and to acquire a new character. The new character would come upon them, he said, if they learned to live with self-respect, social dignity and fearlessness. Underscoring the importance of self-respect and social dignity, he said,  ‘if one lives with dignity and self-respect, the kali would destroy itself’ .   He said when people grew out of kalimayai, Dharma Yukam would unfold itself and in that age, he would rule over the people as Dharma Raja, the king of Dharma Yukam.

==Arrest and imprisonment==

Against the background of the growing popularity of Vaikundar, and the convergence of people around him in multitudes, a complaint seems to have been lodged against him with the king of Travancore. The king arrested Vaikundar and tortured him[tpl]Failed verification|date=November 2009[/tpl].LMS Report of 1838, Page 71: "The Government however, interfered, and the excitement quickly died away."  
There is an opinion that Ayya was arrested on 11 November 1839.Manibharathi, "Samithoppu Ayya Narayana Cuvami - 3" in Tina Tanti Kutumba Malar, in dt.08-01-1995, Page-4 But the date is not mentioned in Akilam.

==Post-imprisonment activities==

After he returned from imprisonment, Vaikundar inspired a group of his devotees to undertake a religious exercise called Thuvayal Thavasu.Akilattirattu Ammanai published by T. Palaramachandarn Nadar, 9th impression, 1989, Page 290-298The LMS Report of 1838, page-71 He also practiced several miracles. He married the Saptha Kanniyar as Narayanar (see:Marriage with the Seven Virgins), the Seven deities in the form of Ekam (see:Marriage with the Deities), He initiated a lot of festivities around him  (see:Festivals and Celebrations)." The deities were made to 'come upon' some of the female devotees who became their human media, and then a marriage ceremony was performed with these human media.Akilattirattu Ammanai published by T. Palaramachandarn Nadar, 9th impression, 1989, Page 336-338 There were ceremonial processions held amidst singing, incantations and shouts of joy by the followers. Several rites and rituals were instituted during these occasions.G.Patrick's, Religion and Subalter agency, Chapter 4, Page 83

==Attaining Vaikundam==

Later Vaikundar was invited by his devotees to their homes and treated in a grand manner. By way of soliciting his blessings, his devotees carried him to different places. During these occasions, he laid foundations in various places for small shrine-like centres, called as Nizhal Thangals. Vaikundar came to recognize five individuals as his closest disciples. Through one of his disciples, Hari Gopalan Citar, he wrote the holy book, called Akilam.Akilattirattu Ammanai published by Vivekanantha Pathippakam, 2004, Page 4 
On 3 June 1851  Vaikundar attained Vaikundam (died. see also:Attaining Vaikundam).Akilattirattu Ammanai published by T. Palaramachandran Nadar, 9th impression, 1989 page However, Samuel Mateer mentions the year as 1848.Samuel Mateer's, The Land of Charity, page-222. 
But today most of the historians opinins it as it is mentioned in Akilam. As he attained Vaikundam his body was interned in a tomb and, around that, a pati (temple) was raised later on. His devotees continued to visit this site, and performed the rituals as they used to do when Vaikundar was bodily present. His life and works remain the foundation of the Ayyavazhi. The head temple of the Ayyavazhi religion is the Swamithoppepathi and is located in the Village of Swamithope.

==Five Citars==

Ayya Vaikundar has five disciples (citars). According to Akilattirattu Ammanai the Pandavas of previous Dwapara Yukam was made to take birth in this Kali Yukam as Citars of Vaikundar. They are:

[[Dalibor (opera)]]

CATEGORIES: Operas by Bedřich Smetana, Czech-language operas, Rescue operas, 1868 operas

Dalibor is a Czech opera in three acts by Bedřich Smetana. The libretto was written in German by Josef Wenzig, and translated into Czech by Ervin Špindler. It was first performed at the New Town Theatre in Prague on 16 May [tpl]fact|date=July 2013[/tpl]Or perhaps 15 May, as given in Novotný's edition.  1868. The opera received criticism at the time for being overly influenced by German opera, including that of Richard Wagner.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://oq.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/14/1/174|last=Jellinek| first=George|authorlink=George Jellinek|title=Dalibor. Bedřich Smetana|journal=The Opera Quarterly|volume=14|issue=1|pages=174–176|date=1997|accessdate=17 October 2007[/tpl]
The subject of the opera is Dalibor of Kozojed (fl. c. 1490), a Czech knight who took part in an uprising in Ploskovice in support of the oppressed people and was sentenced to death in 1498, during the reign of Vladislas II. The plot bears a resemblance to that of Ludwig van Beethoven's opera Fidelio,George Martin, Review of Czech Opera by John Tyrrell. The Opera Quarterly, 6(4), 80–84 (1989). in that the central female characters in each opera disguise themselves in male clothing to try to save the hero.

==Performance history==

Smetana had great affection for the opera, but because of the lukewarm reception, died thinking that he had failed with this opera. The revival in 1886, however, two years after the composer's death, was a success. In the 1890s, the opera received productions in Zagreb, Munich, and Hamburg.John Clapham, "Smetana: A Century after". The Musical Times, 125(1694), pp. 201, 203–205 (April 1984). Gustav Mahler conducted an 1892 production in Vienna.

==Synopsis==

===Act 1===

Dalibor, a Czech Knight is on trial before the king for having murdered the burgrave of Ploskovice in revenge for execution of his friend Zdenek. At the trial, the king calls upon the burgrave’s sister, Milada, who demands his execution. As Dalibor is brought in, the crowd rises in support of him. When Dalibor tells of his friend’s capture and murder the court reduces his sentence from death to lifetime imprisonment. Milada painfully realized that she is falling in love with Dalibor, and in collusion with Jitka (an orphan befriended by the knight), she resolves to set him free.

===Act 2===

Milada enters the prison disguised as a boy and finds employment with Dalibor’s jailer, Benes. She charms Benes into allowing her into dungeon where Dalibor is being held. The Knight greets her with jubilation and, in a passionate düet, they sing of their love for each other.  

===Act 3===

They plot to bribe Benes, but the jailer informs the king of their attempted escape. Taking the advice of his council, the king orders Dalibor’s death. Milada, waiting outside the prison, hears the tolling of the bell that signals Dalibor’s execution. Accompanied by her fallowers, she storms the castle, where, after rescuing Dalibor, she is wounded and dies in his arms. Dalibor stabs himself and is united in death with his beloved. (An alternative ending has Dalibor executed before Milada can rescue him.)

[[Axial chirality]]

CATEGORIES: Stereochemistry

Axial chirality is a special case of chirality in which a molecule does not possess a stereogenic center (the most common form of chirality in organic compounds) but an axis of chirality – an axis about which a set of substituents is held in a spatial arrangement that is not superposable on its mirror image. Axial chirality is most commonly observed in atropisomeric biaryl compounds wherein the rotation about the aryl-aryl bond is restricted, for example, biphenyl, binaphthyls, e.g., 1,1'-bi-2-naphthol, and certain dihydroanthracenone compounds. Absolute stereochemistry of fungal metabolites: Icterinoidins A1 and B1, and atrovirins B1 and B2 Melvyn Gill and Peter M. Morgan Arkivoc (RI-1154C)2004 Online article Certain allene compounds also display axial chirality. The enantiomers of axially chiral compounds are usually given the stereochemical labels Ra and Sa.Compendium of Chemical Terminology, axial chirality The designations are based on the same Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules used for tetrahedral stereocenters. The chiral axis is viewed end-on and the two "near" and two "far" substituents on the axial unit are ranked.

This property can also be called helicity, since the axis of the structure has a helical, propeller, or screw-shaped geometry. P (plus)  or Δ is a right-handed helix, where M (minus) or Λ is a left-handed helix.Compendium of Chemical Terminology, helicityVLU: Additional Chirality Elements - Chemgapedia The P/M or Δ/Λ terminology is used particularly for molecules that actually resemble a helix, such as hexahelicene. It can also be applied to other structures having axial chirality by considering the helical orientation of the "front" vs "back" Cahn–Ingold–Prelog rankings.

Hugh Donnithorne Vyvyan (born 8 September 1976 in Guildford) is a rugby union player who plays at lock for Saracens and England. He stands at 6'6" and weighs around 18 stone.
The former England fullback Jon Callard heavily influenced Hugh's early career while at Downside School, moving him from fly-half to number 8. Brother Charlie, was a number 8 for Sale Sharks, and was another big influence on his career. He also plays lock.
Vyvyan is youngest of seven brothers. In 1993 the brothers created rugby history by making up an entire team in the Penryn Invitation Sevens tournament, (played on Easter day each year in Penryn, Cornwall). The Seven Vyvyan brothers (Richard, Jonathan, Charles, Simon, Paul, James and Hugh) went on to win the tournament, defeating the host club 19 – 17 in the final. They returned the following year and defended the title, with Hugh flying back from South Africa to make up the numbers. In all the brothers reached the final five times, winning three times and twice being runners up.
He opted to take a year out after Downside School and played in South Africa for the Villagers club in Cape Town. Back in England he played briefly for Penryn before starting a successful theology degree at University of Newcastle, where he caught the eye of the Newcastle Falcons and eventually made his debut against Moseley, when the club were in National Division Two.
In 2001 he was an important member of Falcons’ Powergen Cup winning side at Twickenham, a feat he repeated in 2004 as captain.
In 2002 he toured with the full England side and was an unused bench replacement against Argentina.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/international/2060216.stm|title=Argentina beaten by England youngsters|publisher=BBC|date=22 June 2002|accessdate=23 June 2009[/tpl] In that same 2002–2003 season he played for England A against Scotland A and Ireland A and, in December 2003, also helped an England XV beat the New Zealand Barbarians.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/england-youngsters-rise-above-rough-treatment-577398.html|title=England youngsters rise above rough treatment|publisher=The Independent|date=22 December 2003|accessdate=23 June 2009 | location=London | first=Chris | last=Hewett[/tpl]
As well as leading both Newcastle Falcons and now Saracens, he has captained the England A squad on two Churchill Cup tours. The first in 2003 saw England A take the cup and the second, in 2004, saw England A losing to the New Zealand Māori in extra time.

==Etymology and history==

Ayya in Tamil means 'Father'Pon.T. Dharmarasan, Akilathirattu, p. 146 and vazhi, 'the pathway' ; The simple derivative in the sense is  'The Pathway of (or) towards Father' . Apart, due to the diverse synonymous versions for the phrase in Tamil, it also leads to various other theories.R. Shanmugam, Narayana Kulatthil Narayanar Avataram, p. 188Akilathirattu ammanai Arappadanool, First Stage, p. 27, published by Vaikundar Seva Sangam
Ayyavazhi began to be noticed initially by the large number of people gathering to worship Vaikundar (known historically as "Mudisoodum Perumal") (1809 CE –  1851 CE)Vaikundar is a historical as well as mythical figure. The historical Vaikundar (often referred to as 'Vaikunta Swami') refers to a person who lived between 1809 CE –  1851 CE The Akilam myth says that Vaikundar was the God incarnate who incarnates in the body of ' Sampooranathevan ' alias  'Muthukutty'  in 1833 CE and lived to 1851 CE So Akilam, Sampooranathevan lived between 1809 CE and 1833 CE and Vaikundar then incarnated in the body of Mudisoodum Perumal (Sampooranathevan), living from 1833 CE to 1851 CE. at Poovandanthoppe.[ref]

By the middle of 19th century, Ayyavazhi had come to be recognised as a separate religion with deep roots in the regions of South Travancore and South Tirunelveli.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency Chapter 5, p. 91: "By the middle of the nineteenth century, AV (abbreviation of Ayyavazhi) had expanded into a recognisable religious phenomenon, making its presence felt in South Tiruvitankur (Travancore) and in the southern parts of Tirunelveli. From the LMS reports, one gathers the information that AV was spreading with 'extraordinary' speed." The numbers of faithful increased significantly from the 1840s. By the close of the 19th century, Swamithope was considered the religio-cultural epi-center of Ayyavazhi.LMS Report for the year 1872, p. 107. After the time of Vaikundar, Ayyavazhi was spread through his teachings. The five Seedars, disciples of Vaikundar and their descendants, traveled to several parts of the country bearing the mission of Ayyavazhi.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 5, p. 120 "Vaikunda cami chose these disciples as close associates to propagate his teachings and ideas to the people" Meanwhile, the Payyan dynasty started administrating the Swamithoppe pathi,N. Elango and Vijaya Shanthi Elango, Ayya Vaikuntar – The Light of the World Chapter 4, p. 21 "The temple is managed by the Gurus of Lord Vaikuntar's gurukulam. The Gurus are the descendants of Guru Podukutti." while other Pathis came under the administration of the followers of Ayya.N. Elango and Vijaya Shanathi Elango, Ayya Vaikuntar – The Light of The World Chapter 8, pp. 41–44 (sources). Following the instructions of Akilattirattu Ammanai (Akilam), the Nizhal Thangals (small pagodas) have been established across the country for worship and the study of scripture.V.T. Chellam, Thamizaka Varalarum Panpadum, Chapter 12, p. 493
Arul Nool, the first Ayyavazhi work in print was released in 1927, followed by the Akilam in 1933,(Another view has Akilam published in 1939 and Arul Nool in 1918. This uncertainty results from the unfortunate absence of publication data in early editions of the Arul Nool. Source: N. Vivekanandan, Arul Nool Moolamum Uraiyum). almost a century after it had been written down.N. Vivekanandan, Arul Nool Moolamum Uraiyum. As a result, Ayyavazhi abandoned active oral traditions in favor of literary scriptures. Ayyavazhi headquarter reports that Ayyavazhi spread more rapidly after Indian Independence (1940s) and still more rapidly through the 1990s.N. Elango and Vijaya Shanthi Elango, Ayya Vaikuntar The light of the world, p. 61 Many Ayyavazhi-based social welfare organisations were established in the late 20th century.V.T. Chellam,Thamizaka Varalarum Panpadum, Chapter 16, pp. 598–599. Several alternative versions of Akilam, including some controversial versions, were released during the same period.N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum, Part 1, pp.(additional) 18–23 The Anbukkodimakkal Thirucchabai, a democratic bureau, was established by the religious headquarters in the early 1990s to organize and govern the religion. Organisational conferences are held in various cities in South India including Mumbai,[tpl]cite web |url=http://tholthiruma.blogspot.com/2009/02/blog-post_15.html |publisher=tholthiruma.blogspot.com on News report|title=3rd Religious conference|accessdate=15 April 2009 [/tpl] Chennai and Thiruvananthapuram.
Considering the growth of Ayyavazhi, Ayya Vaikunda Avataram, the day of Vaikundar's incarnation, was declared a holiday by the state administration for the district of Kanyakumari in 1994, followed by the districts of Tirunelveli and Tuticorin in 2006.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dinamalar.com/2006mar03/general_tn3.asp |title=Report on declaration of the holiday|publisher=Dina Malar|accessdate=3 February 2007 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]Dr. R.

Bala Prajapathi is the most popular personality among them."

==Scriptures and holy places==

The holy books of Ayyavazhi are the Akilattirattu Ammanai (commonly referred to as )[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/top3mset/20287371|title= www.worldcatlibraries.org|accessdate=23 January 2008 |format= Akilam: vacan̲a kāviyam|work=Publisher: K Patchaimal, Cāmitōppu.[/tpl] and the Arul Nool, and they are the source of the religion's mythology. The Akilattirattu Ammanai was written by Hari Gopalan Seedar in 1841,G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 5, pp. 118–119 "The author claims that God woke him up during sleep and commissioned him to write it by 'telling' him what to write" as if hearing the contents of Akilam told by Narayana to his consort Lakshmi.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 5, p. 119 "It is presented as if Vishnu is narrating the whole story to his consort Leksmi" In addition to the mythological events Akilam also provides an extensive quantity of historical facts,Pon. T. Dharmarasan, Akilathirattu, p. 183. especially that of mid and late 2nd millennium CE. While the original text is damaged, the daughter versions such as the  Swamithope version, the Kottangadu version as well as the Panchalankurichi versions, are the earliest existing palm-leaf versions of Akilam. Other released versions includes the Sentrathisai Ventraperumal, the Kalai Ilakkiya Peravai, the Vivekanandan, the highly criticised VTVN. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum, Part-1. and the earliest and commonly accepted Palaramachandran version. Akilam contains more than 15,000 verses in seventeen sections. It is written in poetic Tamil in a ballad form, and is composed with a unique literal-style with two sub-genres, Viruttam and Natai throughout.
The secondary scripture, Arul Nool, includes various books that are believed to be written by Arulalarkal (one possessed by divine power).G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 5, pp. 119–120 It contains prayers, hymns and instructions for the way of worship in Ayyavazhi, as well as rituals prophesy and many acts. It also contains many events found in the Akilam pertaining to the life of Vaikundar.R. Ponnu, Vaikunda Swamigal Ore Avataram, Ram Publications, pp. 11–12 Unlike Akilam, there is no definitive history for Arul Nool. All these texts are compiled in Tamil language.Dr. C. Poulose, Advaita Philosophy of Brahmasri Chattampi Swamikal, p. 24.
To the Ayyavazhi devotees, there are seven holy places, called Pathis,[tpl]cite book|last=Chryssides|first=George|title=Historical Dictionary of New Religious Movements|year=2011|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=9780810861947|page=48|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=WA12nHRtmAwC&pg=PA48&dq=Ayya+Vaikundar&hl=en&sa=X&ei=X1B_Us7mG4rlrAf4voCwDw&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Ayya%20Vaikundar&f=false[/tpl]R.Shanmugam, Nadar Kulatthil Narayanar Avataram, p. 195 with the Pancha pathis being the most important.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 5, p. 117 " Five such patikal are believed to have emerged during the time of Vaikuntacami. " The temple of the Swamithope pathi is the headquarters of the Ayyavazhi.The New Indian Express(English Daily), Madurai Edition, 3/4/2008.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tsi.org.in/conference/chennai_tourism.asp#temple |title=www.tsi.org.in|accessdate=11 October 2007 |format= Tourism in Chennai|work=Temples: "Swamithoppe – Ayya Vaikundar Pathi, religious head quarters of Ayyavazhi." |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071009031519/http://www.tsi.org.in/conference/chennai_tourism.asp#temple  |archivedate = 9 October 2007[/tpl]N. Elango and Vijaya Shanthi Elango, Ayya Vaikuntar – The Light of the World Chapter 8, p. 41 " The first Pathi is Swamithoppu, the headquarters of Ayyavazhi. "''
The five Pancha pathi are:
1. the Swamithope Pathi, the venue of the great Tavam and the religion's headquarters.
2. Ambala Pathi, where Vaikundar joined six of the Seven Deities unto himself.
3. Mutta Pathi, the venue of the Second and Third Vinchais.
4. Thamaraikulam Pathi, where the Akilattirattu Ammanai was written down.
5. Poo Pathi, where Ayya unified the Earth goddess Poomadanthai to himself by symbolic marriage.
Vakaippathi, though not included in the Pancha pathis by the headquarters, is still considered as a Pathi but with lesser importance.N. Elango and Vijaya Shanthi Elango, Ayya Vaikuntar the light of the world, Chapter 6 (Thuvayal Panthy), p. 31G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 5, p. 117 " However, there is also another list which includes Vakaipati in tuvaiyal tavacu's place " There is disagreement among followers of Ayyavazhi regarding the holiness of some other Pathis, such as Vaikunda Pathi and Avathara Pathi. The list of Pathis announced by the headquarters of Ayyavazhi does not include these Pathis.N. Elango and Vijaya Shanthi Elango, Ayya Vaikuntar the light of the world, Chapter 8, p. 41 (Panchappathi)

==Symbolism==

The symbol of Ayyavazhi is a lotus carrying a flame-shaped white Namam.[tpl]cite book|last=Kulendiren|first=Pon|title=Hinduism a Scientific Religion|year=2012|publisher=iUniverse|location=Bloomington, Indiana.|isbn=9781475936735|page=85|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=bwxDc6B9eokC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] Tha. Krishnanathan, Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum, p. 108. The lotus represents the 1,008-petalled Sahasrara (in Tamil, Ladam), while the Namam represents the Aanma Jyothi or atman. Both of the Ayyavazhi scripturesAkilam15:39 "Petti ceelai Uduthu Periya Thirunama Pottumittu"Sivakanda Athikara Pathiram, First Act. Source: N. Vivekanandan's Arul Nool – Moolamum Uraiyum, p. 62 refer to Thirunamam (the "flame shaped symbol" present in the top of the Lotus in the Ayyavazhi symbol), but not to the lotus directly. The symbol is the ideological summary of Akilam-based philosophy. This symbol has been in use since the mid-20th century.In the abcense of written references, there is a painting at the residence of Bala Prajapathi Adikalar which was considered older, but is not less than 50 years. There are also oral traditions which suggests the same age for this symbol.
The mythical narration in akilam about the eight yugas is often viewed philosophically as a reference to eight chakras.A. Arisundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, pp. (Additional) XII–XIII " Athara thana vilakka attavanai ". The first Neetiya Yukam, is Bindu and the final state, Dharma Yukam, is Sahasrara, or absolute bliss. In this series, the energy of consciousness (Namam) of oneself is invoked, rising from Bindu (Neetiya Yukam) to the final Sahasrara (Dharma Yukam). This lotus, the highest spiritual center of enlightenment is for experiencing the absolute "bliss".A. Arisundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, p. 374. The reigning power in the final Dharma Yukam (Sahasrara) is Ekam, which is a part of Vaikundar a Trinity conception, or a manifestation of the supreme absolute. Thus Ayyavazhi's symbol is derived from Akilam. The symbol, "Lotus with Thirunamam", shows "Vaikundar's experienced in Sahasrara."
In certain Hindu texts the Sahasrara chakra has 1000 petals.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kheper.net/topics/chakras/Sahasrara.htm |publisher=kheper.net |title= Sahasrara Chakra|accessdate=3 February 2007 [/tpl] But in Ayyavazhi symbolism, Saharara has 1008 petals. In Ayyavazhi, there is no scriptural authority indicating the importance of 1000, but the number 1008 is commonly mentioned. Also, the incarnation year of Vaikundar is 1008 M.E. (Malayalam Era). Backing these scriptural identities, the 1008-petal lotus is followed in Ayyavazhi symbolism. Sahasrara is symbolised as a lotus without a stem.
Ayyavazhi architecture was developed in constructing Nizhal Thangals, where the inverted lotus flower of Sahasrara is used to cover the roof.See this Image:Image:Nelli Nintra Vilai Thangal.png, a Nizhal Thangal constructed in this architectural manner near Marthandam, Tamil Nadu. The lotus may also represent the heart and the flame shape (Thirunamam), the divinity.Pulavar. R. Shanmugam's, (2000), Nadar Kulathil Narayanar Avatharam, Nadar Kulatheebam Publications, p. 207
Ayyavazhi has used other symbols including Vaishnavite ' Triple Namam '(not used currently), and Conch.

==Teachings and impact==

The majority of Ayyavazhi's key teachings can be found in the book Akilattirattu Ammanai and other teachings are collated from various books written by unknown authors, whose works feature in the Arul Nool.N. Vivekanandan, Arul Nool Moolamum Uraiyum, p. 8 Like Dharma, the other teachings of Ayyavazhi are twofold, sociological and mystical. The mystical teachings are devoted to revealing divine knowledge, while social teachings are primarily concerned with eliminating inequality and discrimination in society. The teachings encourage a positive relationship with God, as opposed to one based on fear. Followers are encouraged to refer to God as Ayya, "dear father", to strengthen their intimacy and affection towards God.Dr. R. Ponnu, Ayya Vaikundar Ore Avatharam, pp. 128–129
Ayyavazhi mystics focus on supreme oneness.A. Ari Sundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, p. 384 Among its variations, the theology always maintains this focus on oneness. The evil of Kali blocks the ultimate or supreme oneness prevailing between individual souls and the universe, creating among them a false sense of individuality and of extreme pride. This erroneous view causes the apparent sense of separation from the oneness and motivates against it.N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanaiyil Vaikunda Suvami Sampooranathevana?, p. 12 Ekam—the "over-soul" or the supreme soul—is identified as the whole of existence, changeless in nature and ubiquity. This is "one which undergoes different changes with respect to space and time" because of the evil force maya.A. Ari Sundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, pp. 103–121
All of creation evolved from this Ekam, the supreme consciousness.N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum, p. 97 All the qualities of Ekam are within each soul, and evolve from it. Each and every individual soul is a reflection or mirror of the absolute Supreme, Ekam,T. Krishnanathan, Ayya Vaikundarin vazvum Sinthanaiyum, pp. 60–61. which provides the textual basis and metaphor for the mirror's role in Ayyavazhi worship. Human and all other souls are restricted and limited by the evil of Kali. This is why individual souls are not able to attain supreme bliss, and so are secondary to Ekam. Once a soul overcomes the influence of maya, it becomes one with Ekam. Its individuality is gone, and thereby it is Ekam.N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanaiyil Vaikunda Suvami Sampooranathevana?, p. 14 On the other hand, this supreme consciousness is personified as Paramatma (over-soul) by which, God is the "Husband", while all other souls are his "consorts",Ari Sundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayan Urai, p. 534 symbolised by Thirukkalyana Ekanai, where Vaikundar marries the individual souls. Also, the Ayyavazhi philosophy applies a common formula for the creation of human beings and the rest of the universe. Thus whatever exists externally to human beings exists also internally.P. Sundaram Swamigal and K. Ponnumani, Ucchippadippu, pp. 32–33.
Ayyavazhi clearly and explicitly condemns the caste based inequalities in its social teachings.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 5, p. 114 " Other verses from Akilattirattu like, 'throw the eighteen castes and the demons into the mountain and the sea', 'do not discriminate between the powerful and powerless', 'the caste would disappear by itself', etc., point to the fact of a considerable indoctrination against the inequalities of Castes." It heavily criticises the caste discrimination rather than the 'Caste system' itself.
From its inception, Ayyavazhi has also served as an engine of social reform, particularly in the area of Travancore, which was previously noted for its unusually strong caste system.Cf.

This is most clearly seen in Akilam, where the Thiruvithkanur king is identified as Kalineesan, (one who is a captive of Kali) and the British are identified as Venneesan (the white neesan) in the social sense.Akilattirattu Ammanai, published by T.

==Worship centers==

The followers of Ayyavazhi established Pathis and Nizhal Thangals, which are centers of worship and religious learning in various parts of the country.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, pp. 116–117 They serve as centres for propagation of the beliefs and practices of Ayyavazhi.

Poulose, Advaita Philosophy of Brahmasri Chattampi Swamikal, p. 24, "To propagate his teachings and ideas he opened up 7 Pathis and 7 Tangs (The Primary Nizhal Thangals) in Travancore as well as hundreds of small pagodas (Nizhal Thangals) throughout India." Accrediting the Worship centers of Ayyavazhi across India and so the Ayyavazhi followers.R.

"(The head quarters of all these Nizhal Thangals which are found across the country, is at the place called Swamithoppe as told earlier.)" mostly in South India. A research paper approved by Madurai Kamaraj University reports more than 8000 worship centres in Tamil Nadu and Kerala alone.Tha. Krishna Nathan's, Ayyaa vaikuNdarin vaazvum sinthanaiyum (Tamil), Chapter 4, p. 83: "இதற்கு ஆதாரமாக அய்யா வைகுண்டரைத் தெய்வமாக ஏற்றுக்கொண்ட சுமார் 8000 – க்கும் மேற்பட்ட அய்யாவழிப் பதிகள் தமிழ்நாடு மற்றும் கேரளப்பகுதிகளில் இயங்குவதைக் கூறலாம்." (This citation is from a Tamil Wikipedia article) Reports from the London Missionary Society (LMS) of the mid-19th century also speak of Nizhal Thangals.From the following reports: James Town Mission District for 1863, Neyoor Mission District for 1869, Santhapuram Mission District for 1858, Nagercoil Mission District for 1864, from the ARTDC for the respective years. Since Ayyavazhi is not centrally organised, Swamithope pathi serves as the religious headquarters for all. The Pathis earn more importance among the worship centers.
The seven Pathis, obtain their significance from the fact that Vaikundar and his activities were historically associated with these centers of worship. The Swamithope pathi, though considered the religion's headquarters, does not officially control the rest of the religious centers. All Pathis, except itself, are managed by independent committees.N. Elango and Vijaya Shanthi Elango, Ayya Vaikuntar – The Light of the World, pp. 41–44 The five Pathis known as Pancha pathi are considered foremost among Pathis.
Nizhal Thangals, compared with Pathis, are simple small structures built for worship and for learning the teachings of Vaikundar. They also served as centers of school education during the early days.R. Ponnu, Vaikundacuvamikal Valvum Valikattalum, p. 71. Food and shelter are offered to the needy in these centres.P. Sarvesvaran, Sri Vaikunda Swamikal – A Forgotten Social Reformer, p. 8. Some of them were established when Vaikundar was alive. Among them Arul Nool, specifies seven Thangals,G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency Chapter 5, p. 118. Vaikuntacami is said to have established seven of these nilaltankalkal at Chettykudiyirrupu, Agastisvaram, Palur, Chundavilai, Vadalivilai, Kadampankulam and Pampankulam. and these are considered primary over the others. Today, charity is one of the main activities conducted in these centers.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency Chapter 5, p. 118.
These centers emerged as the abode of Dharma.Journal of Dharma (1985), Published by 'Center for the Study of World Religions', Dharmaram College, Bangalore. The Nizhal Thangals form an important institution in the socio-religious life of the people of Ayyavazhi. Panividai may be conducted up to three times daily, but all worship centers provide Panividai at least once daily.

==Ethics==

The ethics of Ayyavazhi, integrated with the meta-narrative mythology, are found throughout the primary scripture, Akilattirattu Ammanai.T. Krishnanathan, Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum, p. 112. Regarding ethics, Arul Nool is an accumulation of the core concepts found in Akilam.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern agency, Chapter 5, p. 120 In Akilam, the ethical abstracts are pointed out as "told by God" at several places at different situations to lesser god-heads, devas, saints, etc. when ever asked by them.
Neetham is the primary virtue of Ayyavazhi. This shows how society, its people, the ruling king, etc., lived in absolute harmony with nature, placing the power of Almighty in all their works, deeds and activities during early ages. In return, nature and the divine beings protect the society which follows the Neetham. Chastity and life in ultimate union with nature form the central theme, an ethical form that is to be followed. As in Akilam, Vinchai is the rules and regulations provided by God (Narayana) to Vaikundar. There are three such Vinchais. Acts found there also fit to humans to improve their moral code. The first Vinchai of Tiruchendur forms the largest ethical accumulation found in Akilam.
To an extent, the Dharmic teachings in Ayyavazhi are also considered as ethics. Charity in social ethics and "attempting to realise the ultimate truth of oneness" in spirituality are the ethical codes under the banner of Ayyavazhi dharma. Akilam also gives separate ethics for Devas also.Mani Bharathi, Akilathirattu Ammanai Vilakka Urai (Part – 2). It is notable that the Ayyavazhi ethics undergo a vast deviation from the incarnation of Vaikundar since a universal change took place then. Over all, as the foremost ethical code, people are advocated to overcome the evil force kalimayai with the weapons of love, forbearance and peace, since Kaliyan as maya rules the minds of people.
Arul Nool constitutes the major role in forming the rules and regulations of Ayyavazhi, including ethics. It gives separately the social as well as divine ethics. The Sivakanda Athikara Pathiram here is the section especially dedicated to teach the ethics. The rituals, especially circumambulations, are to be followed to wash-out the sin committed related to immoral thinking.

==Religious studies==

It is difficult to give a clear-cut listing to Ayyavazhi concepts because of the relation the Ayyavazhi scriptures maintains with the Hindu scriptures. Akilam primarily says the central themes of the existing scriptures (that of Hindu) had gone awry by the advent of Vaikundar.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern agency, 'The Religious Phenomenon of Ayya Vali', p.119. It also narrates that Akilam was given to mankind as an alternative because Kaliyan destroyed the original Vedas and Shastras, and at the beginning of Kali Yuga, several additions were given to the previous scriptures by him.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, pp. 120–121. Both of these view points give the views of Akilam on Hindu scriptures, and place them as reasons for rejecting them.
The philosophy, terms and mythology of the Ayyavazhi scriptures are the basis of religious study on Ayyavazhi theology.P. Sundaram Swamigal and K. Ponnu Mani, Ayya Vaikunta Nathar Jeevacharithram, pp. 20–21 But several terms quoted in Akilam couldn't be understood wholly unless by referring to the descriptive details of those terms in Hindu scriptures.N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanaiyil Vaikunda Suvami Sampooranathevana?, pp.10–20. For example, if the 96 tatvas are understood, then the Kaliyan is understood. Therefore theologians and philosophers today turn to Hindu scriptures to further their understanding of the tatvas as properties of the human body, which are not elaborated upon in Akilam.N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum, pp. 190–191. However, to understand Akilam and its philosophy, one should have a basic knowledge over the Hindu ideas and concepts. Since Akilam have no different view in this matter from Hindu scriptures, it was left to be gathered from there.
On mythical studies, Akilam covers almost the entire main mythology of Hinduism, including Mahabharata, Ramayana, Kantha Purana and Vishnu Purana, but with limited details.T. Krishnanathan, Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum, p.62. It includes only the main events that are directly linked to the main-stream story flow. But to undergo a detailed study on each, the appropriate Hindu scriptures that include those events in detail need to be referred. Akilam provides all these collectively in brief with an overall story line, which make it unique.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern agency, 'The Social Discourse of Ayya Vali', pp.151. Many philosophical concepts from Hinduism are found in Akilam; some of them are completely accepted,G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern agency, 'The Social Discourse of Ayya Vali', p.155. some are regenerated, while others are rejected.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern agency, 'The Social Discourse of Ayya Vali', pp.130–131.
Generally it was considered that once a particular concept is not found well-described in Ayyavazhi scriptures, such as Akilattirattu Ammanai or Arul Nool (as detail as in Hindu scriptures), and instead simply was quoted, then that particular conception is accepted as in Hindu scriptures for religious studies. But once Akilam has different views over something from that of the existing (Hindu) scriptures, then it would be found deeply described in Akilam itself and hence no need for referring other scriptures.Arisundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, p. (additional) v. To be noted, Whole contents of this book is written including the heavy details to 'mere noted' Akilam concepts from Hindu scriptures.

==God==

The theology of Ayyavazhi differs considerably from other monistic religions.V.T. Chellam, Thamizaka Varalarum Panpadum, Chapter 12, p. 493 It speaks of Ekam, the Oneness from which all that exists formed, and also an ultimate oneness that exists behind all differences. The Ekam, which is articulated as the supreme divine power itself, is supposed to remain unaffected by maya deep inside every changeable matters as an absolute constant. In theological terms, God is, in the highest sense, formless, infinite, genderless and beyond time and space. The term Ekam in Tamil language give simply the meanings, "one", "absolute",M. Winslow (1869), A Comprehensive Tamil and English Dictionary, American Mission Press (Madras), ISBN 81-206-0001-0, p. 185 "the whole which exists"V.T. Ramasupramaniyam, Thirumagal Thamizhagarathi, p. 210 and "the incomparable";Narmadavin Thamizh Agarathi, p. 173. all give some sort of direct monistic definition about God from Ayyavazhi theology.
Narrating through mythology, The Sivam and the Sakthi are the first to get evolved from Ekam. The Natham(voice), Trimurthi, other lesser gods and the entire universe further evolved. The Trimurthi are greater among the personified Devas. Siva, one among the Trimurthi, was the supreme power until Kali Yuga. Vishnu is the supreme from the advent of Kali Yuga. Then, from the incarnation of Vaikundar, again the powers of all god-heads, including that of Vishnu, is transformed to Vaikundar. Ekam, the supreme oneness as one among the Trinity takes a place within Vaikundar for the present age. Therefore, Vaikundar is said to be the only worshippable and supreme power. However, a quote from Akilam thirteen says this supreme oneness (Ekam) itself is created by Vaikundar, who is a personified God. In this regard, Ayyavazhi being centered on Vaikundar, is more monotheistic rather than monistic. No other god-heads, even the Father of Vaikundar, Narayana, have gained an equal or greater status than Vaikundar.  Vaikundar is a turbine power who includes the qualities of the Santror, Narayana and Ekam within himself.
In Ayyavazhi mythology, Kroni, a primordial evil manifestation, was fragmented into six and each fragments took birth and plays an anti-Vishnu roles throughout the successive six yugas. He was finally destroyed by a final judgment which is followed by the god-ruled Dharma Yukam. This narration gives some dualistic dimension to Ayyavazhi theology. But since the focus of Arul Nool, the accumulation of Ayyavazhi teachings is extremely monistic and since the final fragment of Kroni itself is called Kalimayai (a conception rather than a physical or material incarnation), it was commonly accepted that the 'Maya' is symbolised in such a wayArisundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, Chapter 1, p. 36, "Kroni is nothing but a subtle revelation of spiritual ignorance." that contrasts the dualistic view on Ayyavazhi. Apart from all these, there are also separate quotes in Ayyavazhi scriptures which give pantheistic and panentheistic definition to Ayyavazhi theology.

==Festivals and rituals==

There are two yearly festivals for Ayyavazhi. The Ayya Vaikunda Avataram is celebrated on the twentieth day of the Tamil month Masi (March – April). This is the only Ayyavazhi festival to be celebrated as per the Solar calendar.Tha. Krishna Nathan, Ayyaa vaikundarin vaazvum sinthanaiyum, Chapter 4, p. 74. The mass procession conducted on this day from Nagercoil to Swamithoppe is a popular one in this part of the country.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.dinamalar.com/2007mar05/district/kanyakumari.asp#3%20(Dinamalar)|title= Dina Malar|accessdate=5 March 2007 |format= Kanyakumari District|work=Ayya Vaikundar Avathara Dina Vizha[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The Thiru Edu-Vasippu is a festival of seventeen days celebrated in the Tamil month of Karthigai (November–December). This celebration of textual reciting as a festival itself is a unique feature to Ayyavazhi. Apart from this, there is a tri-yearly celebration of Kodiyettru Thirunal in Swamithope. Another unique feature is the celebration of every day as a festival in Swamithope,(exclusive to Swamithope) called as  'Nitham Thirunal' .Tha. Krishna Nathan, Ayyaa vaikundarin vazhvum sinthanaiyum, Chapter 4, p. 70.
In addition to the philosophical concepts and mythology, the rituals of Ayyavazhi evolved in their own way. Most of the rituals have different operational and historical meanings.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, p. 19 Historically, the rituals were used or viewed as an attempt to break the caste-based inequalities prevailed in the society of the time, and to strengthen and uplift the sociologically downtrodden and ill-treated. Examples of this include the charity on food as  'Anna Dharmam' , physical as well as spiritual cleanliness through Thuvayal Thavasu,The Quarterly Journal of the Mythic Society (1986), Published by 'Mythic Society', Bangalore, India, v.77 (1986). eliminating untouchability through Thottunamam, self-respect and courage through headgear,T. Krishnanathan, Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum, pp. 93–96. and unifying various castes through Muthirikkinaru.Akilathirattu p. 252: "the eighteen castes gathered in one place and bathed from the same well."
But they too reveal, however, high philosophical ideas preached in a ritual language. The Muthirikkinaru and Thirunamam are treated religiously as if the Patham and Namam of them have the power to heal all sorts of mentalN. Amalan, Ayya Vaikundar Punitha Varalaru, Akilam Publications, 86–87: "முத்திரிபுகளை (மும்மலம்) போக்க முத்திரிக்கிணற்றில் பதம் விட்டுக்கொள்ள வேண்டும்". as well as physical illness.The LMS Report for the year 1847, pp. 88–89: "They take no medicine; but rub ashes on the forehead and drink cold water as the cure for all their diseases." Thuvayal thavasu is suggested as a training to reach the ultimate aim of Dharma Yukam.A. Ari Sundaramani, Akilathirattu Ammani Parayana Urai, p. 485. The use of the crown reveals that "all are kings", visualising an ideology similar to advaita. Also, Ayyavazhi scriptures succeeded very much in helping to understand these philosophical ideas to the common mass which is very much unusual. The individual rituals, the ecstatic religiosity and the ritual healing, which are the features of Ayyavazhi worship, contributed to the formation of an idea of emancipation and a social discourse.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, p. 137. Rituals attempt to uplift and treat the disenfranchised. Another important thing to be noted is the alternative phrases religiously used in Ayyavazhi universe different from Hinduism, to represent certain practices.

==Inclusiveness and exclusivity==

The formula of inclusiveness and exclusivity, as applied in the religio-cultural universe of Ayyavazhi, is unique because both the theories are mixed up in Ayyavazhi scriptures. The inclusive theory accepts the views of different religions for a certain period of time, and from then onwards exclusively rejects all of them in its narrative.
Ayyavazhi accepts different god-heads of several religions, like the concept of Allah and almost all the god-heads of Hinduism.T. Krishnanathan, Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum, pp. 61–65. It also says that the one and the same God incarnates in different parts of the world at different time for rescuing the people from sufferings. But due to the advent of Kaliyan and because of the cruel nature of his boons, for the first time, the supreme power Ekam incarnates in the world as Vaikundar, and so all the lesser god-heads and previous scripturesPon. T. Dharmarasan, Akilathirattu, Chapter 3, p. 30. had lost their substances. So after the time of the Vaikunda Avatar, Vaikundar was said to be the only worshippable God and hence, the theology of Ayyavazhi was channeled towards exclusivism. The manner in which Akilam treats the scriptures of different religions is complicated. For instance, while there is no direct reference to the terms 'Christ' or 'Bible' anywhere in any of the Ayyavazhi texts, there is an indirect reference in Akilam thirteen which is supposed to be an implication that Christ was an incarnation of Narayana, but it was widely thought that it did not recognise the Bible composition. It seems the view of Akilam on Bible is "it was created with the intention of man and not that of God"."He created a Veda (scripture) of his own intention". – Akilam5:571 In common, creation of religions and shaping individualities for them are heavily criticised. The concepts 'God' and 'Religion' are kept poles apart in Akilam, and it seems to maintain an ideology something like  'Accept God; Reject religion' .Arisundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai p. 470.
Ayyavazhi accepts various incarnations in Hinduism, but necessarily rejects the so-called ' Hindu ' scriptures. It initially accepts Vedas.Akilam 12:151 – "Poorana Vetha Purana mun akamangkal" Later since Kaliyan had bought the Vedas as boon they too lost their substance by the advent of Kaliyan, and so had gone invalid. It also says that he (Kaliyan) had performed several additions and had hidden some of their content. And hence God incarnated as Vaikundar. So for the present age, Akilam is said to be the only  'Book of Perfection' . By this Ayyavazhi rejects all other scriptures and follows only its own. Akilam highly condemns the creation of religions especially exclusivistic religious and theological ideas. It shows them as the foremost Kali mayai (evil of Kali).R. Ponnu, Vaikunda Swamikal Ore Avataram, pp. 114 -116. The scriptures teach sensibly and symbolically that God and his activities are beyond the reach of religions. It also preaches about universal oneness.

==Mythology==

The mythology of Ayyavazhi narrates that the essence of this vision is an account of a history – a past, a present and a future – meant by weaving together of empirical facts, historical events as well as mythical accounts.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern agency Chapter 6, p. 151, "A reading of the mythography of AV makes explicit the fact that the essence of this vision is an account of a history – a past, a present, and a future – constructed by weaving together of empirical facts as well as mythical accounts." It moves around three axiomatic typologies, namely Santror, Kali Yukam and Dharma Yukam, placing their base on the concepts and events of previous yugas that are associated also with Hindu mythology. The basic concepts give a symbolic vision which is at once religious and social.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern agency Chapter 6, p. 151, "It is fitting to analyse and see how these basic concepts have been woven together to give a symbolic vision which is at once religious and social."
It is closely linked to that of Hinduism. Akilam talks about the previous yugas and the evolution of Kroni through them. Events, mythical characters, and concepts are shared with Hinduism, though they may be engendered in different form. The number of Yugas and Avatars differs in Ayyavazhi from Hinduism.Pon. T. Dharmarasan, Akilathirattu, Introduction, p. 1. The personification of the entity of Evil for the current yuga, Kaliyan, is unique to Ayyavazhi. Akilam says that the true concepts were destroyed, so that all previous scriptures had lost their substances due to the advent of Kali.Akilam8:Thiru Nadana Ula −6th&11th Venpaas (a species of verse).
The book also speaks of God incarnating in the world in the Kali Yukam (the present age) to destroy the evil spirit, the final and the most serious manifestation of Kroni. God incarnates as Vaikundar, and since Vaikundar lived recently, he was well known in history. So in the second part of the mythology many mythical as well as historical facts were woven together. Most of the events such as Muthirikkinaru,Samuel Zecharia (1826–1906), one of the prominent pastors of the London Mission Society, testifies to the existence of this well in his book titled The London Missionary Society in South Travancore 1805–1855, Nagercoil: LMS Press, 1897, p. 201. Wearing of Headgear during worship,M.S.S. Pandiyan, Meanings of 'Colonialism and 'Nationalism p. 180. Thuvayal ThavasuLMS Report for 1838, p. 71 says "About 70 families of this sect, having subsequently established a community of goods, removed under the guidance of a man of some influence to a part of the seashore of Tinnevelly, where they erected huts, performed frequent ablutions, and often assembled to hear the dreams and vision of their leader and to witness the miracles he was said to perform." all were noted in history.
Though there are quotes in Arul Nool to accredit the ten Avatars of Vishnu, it seems that they are not seen in equal status with these incarnations (as in the table). It was considered secondary to the primary avatars, who are associated with the destructions of the fragments of Kroni. This view is not inconsistent with Hinduism, as only Narasimha, Rama and Krishna are considered the primary avatars who are still worshipped. The other avatars are considered secondary avatars who are not worshipped.

==Santror and Dharma yukam==

The Santror is the subject of the religious vision of Ayyavazhi.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, p. 151 "Canror (Santror) is a name that stands for a people who are the subject of the religious vision of AV (Ayyavazhi)" There is both a religious and a social category in its connotation.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, pp. 151–152. In the social sense, it is believed that the term Santror fits rightly to the early "Chanars", who were called by the Arabs as "Al Hind", and known in biblical times as the "People of Five Rivers"; they are now scattered with more than 250 branches throughout the world. But in turn, in ideological sense and from the literary meaning of the term "Santror" in Tamil, it represents one who is noble and lives with dignityR. Ponnu, Sri Vaikunda Swamigal and the Struggle for Socil Equality in South India, p. 23, line 5. and supreme knowledge,A. Arisundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, Chapter 3, p. 92. giving an inclusive character and universal reach. Historians account that in ancient dravidian cultures, zealous devotees of God were called as 'Chanars'.Pon. T. Dharmarasan, Akilathirattu, Chapter 3, p. 25. A quote from Akilam too reads, "Chanars (Santror) are those who have the ability to see 'the invisible' constantly."
The Santror are given a historical background in Ayyavazhi mythology as seven boys who were made to born in the mythical garden Ayodha Amirtha Vanam (supposed to be between present-day Srirangam, Tamil Nadu and Triconamalee, Sri Lanka) by using the seven seeds from seven upper worlds, by Thirumal, to the seven virgins. Theologians interpret that these 'Seven boys' refer to the ancestors of the whole human race, and hence the term "Santror" refers to the entire human race.A. Arisundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, Chapter 3, p. 90. Their lineage started at the end phase of Dvapara Yukam and continued through the Kali Yukam into the Dharma Yukam. It is believed that Kali is being destroyed continuously by the activities of the Santror in the Path of Vaikundar, and so the Dharma Yukam unfolds eventually. In this sense they have a considerable roll in the destruction of Kali, the foremost evil.
The Ayyavazhi proposes an emancipatory utopia under the banner of Dharma Yukam.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, p. 159 says, "AV, having emerged in a context of distress, proposes an emancipatory utopia under the banner of tarmayukam." The basis of the belief is that Ayya Vaikundar had come to establish and rule as the everlasting kingG. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 5, p. 109 says, "Akilattirattu begins its narration by stating that the account contained in it is the story of God coming into this kaliyukam to transform it into tarmayukam and to rule over it." over the Dharma Yukam in the place of Kali YukamG. Patrick's Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, p. 159 says, "The core of the proposal was that Vaikuntacami had come to establish and rule over a tarmayukam in the place of the kaliyukam." after sentencing Kroni to hell by a final judgment from the Lion-throne of Dwaraka pathi, the rising mythical landmass (which was sunken at the end of Dwapara Yuga by Krishna) located south east of present-day Kanyakumari.Sm. Ramasamy, Geomatics in Tsunami, p. 04, "Also in Ayyavazhi mythology the 'Akilathirattu Ammanai'  tells about a sunken land at about 152 miles sout or south-east to kanyakumari with 16008 streets." The Dharma Yukam is narrated as beyond the limits of time and space.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, p. 161, "Yet another point to be taken note of in the symbolic vision of AV is its conception of time. AV gives a list of seven aeons, and, at the end of it, postulates a tarmayukam that is to exist eternally ..." It is often related to Moksha—the personal liberation, and to the state of 'Oneness' too.Ari Sundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, pp. 657–658Mani Bharathi, Akilathirattu Vilakka Urai (Part 2), pp. 300–301

==Relation with Hinduism==

The Hindu and Ayyavazhi ideologies are closely tied to each other. The place where Ayyavazhi and Hinduism depart from each other is at the advent of Kali Yuga. Akilam says that until the advent of Kali Yuga, the Vedas and all other Hindu scriptures remained with Divinity. Each of the gods referred to in the scriptures (Hindu) also remained with all their powers. But from the beginning of Kali Yuga, they and all their virtues collapsed.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, p. 214 Kaliyan was a part of the mundane primordial manifestation who spread maya or illusion upon the existing scriptures and Devas.T. Kirushnanathan, Ayya Vaikundarin Vazvum Sinthanaiyum, p. 63. In Kali Yuga, all true scriptures are bound to maya and are unhelpful.
The reason, as stated in Akilam for the disintegration of the entire system is that, towards the end of Dwapara Yuga, there in Mount Kailash, Siva believing the words of devas, created Kaliyan without discussing to Vishnu, who had the responsibility to destroy Kaliyan as per previous deeds.T. Krishnanathan, Ayya Vaikundar Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum, p. 106 So Vishnu refused to take birth in the world to destroy Kaliyan.N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum, Part 1, p. 315 So Siva and Brahma surrendered all their powers to Vishnu.N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum, Part 1, p. 321 Until this event, Siva was the supreme power as per Akilam. It is notable that this is a theological idea something similar to Shaivism, where Siva is supreme to all. Then onwards, however, Vishnu is the supreme power.Pon. T. Dharmarasan, Akilathirattu, p. 52 Here the ideology changes similar to that of Vaishnavism. This supremacy of Vishnu remains like this from the beginning of Kali Yuga until the incarnation of Vaikundar, from where it changes further.
During the incarnation, Vishnu himself can not incarnate directly in the world to destroy Kaliyan, since he (Kaliyan) had bought as boon the power of Devas, including Vishnu's, and spread it all over the world as maya. So God needs to be incarnated with a new set of rules and with unique importance. A total universal transformation of the power relation of god-heads, the rules of scriptures, the dharma, etc., took place, and Vaikundar was given birth by taking in the power of Ekam, by Lakshmi and Vishnu conjoining together inside the sea.A. Arisundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammani Parayan Urai, pp. 270–271
And from now onwards all the powers were handled over from Vishnu to Vaikundar inside the sea. Siva, Vishnu and Brahma therefore form a part within Vaikundar.A. Arisundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammani Parayan Urai, pp. 288–289 This ideology about Trimurthi (three are equal in power) is similar to that of Smartism. Vishnu alone forms a double role; one, within Vaikundar, and the other, as the father of him, remain inside the sea and regulating Vaikundar through Vinchais. After Vaikundar was given birth to, by assuming the Power of Ekam, Vaikundar was supreme to Vishnu and all other God-heads, though Vishnu playing the role of Father to Vaikundar. However, Vaikundar had to obey the order of Vishnu, since Vaikundar was given birth to perform the duties of Vishnu, which he (Vishnu) could not do. Vaikundar (and scriptures given by him) is the manifestation of the supreme Ekam so, in Ayyavazhi spirituality, he is the only worshippable universal powerA. Arisundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammani Parayan Urai, pp. 290–291
Regarding scriptures, the first part of Akilam is summed-up events of the previous yugas, which are present in Hindu scriptures.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, p. 119 The second part says about the universal transformation and the uniqueness of Vaikundar and his incarnational activities. So as a summary, till the beginning of Kali yuga, what is Hinduism, that is Ayyavazhi. From then onwards for a series of reasons, Akilam says that 'Hindu' scriptures and its ideology had lost its purity and was destroyed,N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum, Part 1, p. 427 and so the Dharma was re-configured in the name of Akilam and Vaikundar and the 'Hindu' ideas were re-formed.

==Phenomenology==

[[File:Prajapathi Adikalar.jpg|thumb|left|Prajapathi Adikalar, Last Descendant of the Payyan family of Swamithope pathi.]]
Akilam points out its basis as a regeneration of Dharma in the form of an entirely new ideology.Akilam8:Thiruvasakam – 1 (As per Akilam this Thiruvasakam is written down by Sarasvathi because the previous religious ideas and scripture were destroyed by Kaliyan.) But today, most of the followers of Ayyavazhi address Vaikundar merely as the incarnation of Vishnu. Likewise, most of the Nizhal Thangals were called Narayana Swami Pathi or Narayana Swami Temple, similar to Hindu Vaishnavism. Most of the followers also worship Hindu deities such as Kali, Hanuman and other folk deities in spite of the anti-polytheistic ideas based on Ayyavazhi scripture.Vaikundar Seva Sangham's,Ayya Vaikundar 170th Avathar-Special Edition, The activities of Nizhal Thangals, pp. 2–4.
Some followers of Ayyavazhi include Vaikundar as part of the ten Avatars of Vishnu as Kalki, while some denominations strongly advocate moksha, the personal liberation, though it is not stated directly in Akilam. Some even reject the Trinity conception in Ayyavazhi and believe Narayana to be the supreme universal power.Arisundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, Chapter 1, p. 1, "Sreehari who is known as Athi Narayana is praised as Ayya." The unique monotheistic belief which is the central theme of Akilam is completely unknown among most of the followers today. Deviating far away from the strict monotheistic teachings of Akilam, some thangals provides panividais for other lesser gods too.
The spread of Ayyavazhi among the common people was mainly due to the practice of Shamanism. Being similar to Hindus in almost all aspects Ayyavazhi followers are hard to be identified. The only sign to distinguish the practitioners of Ayyavazhi is the fact that they wore the Thirunamam (a sign on their forehead).R. Shunmugam, Nadar Kulathi Narayanar Avataram, pp. 189–191 The Nizhal Thangals are identified among the other temples by the fact that idols are replaced by mirrors in the Palliyarai. Only the recitations of a handful of scholars educated in the Ayyavazhi scriptures point out the real facts and concepts of Akilam and the philosophical and ideological deviation of Ayyavazhi from Hinduism.Samithopu Ayya Vaikunda Suvami 172-vathu avathara thina vizha, Thina Malar vazangkum Avathara Thina vizha Sirappu Malar, p. 3, " ... but it is questionable that how many people know that. Every one who came to know newly about Ayya wonders and ..." Bala Prajapathi Adikalar writes about Vaikundar. Not even the Payyans from the headquarters able to portray the Akilam-based ideology clearly.Court Judgement, District Court, Nagercoil, Case: O.S. No.80/1110,  "The doctrines and the philosophic basis of this cult are not clearly known. Not even the 2nd defendant who is one of the hereditary high priests in the temple (Swamithope Pathi) and who enjoys the Gurusthanam of the community is able to throw much light on the question, whether there are any essential or fundamental differences between the Narayanaswamy margom (Ayyavazhi) and the Popular Hinduism" All these philosophical, ideological and religious variations in the society of Ayyavazhi make them hard to be identified and differentiated as a separate belief and instead taken as a Hindu sect.

==Social structure==

Ayyavazhi worship was marked by its simplicity. The absence of idol worship and priestly mediation, and inclusion of alternate type of centres of worship, the Pathis and Nizhal Thangals, were other characteristics of Ayyavazhi worship. Rituals of Ayyavazhi are a reform or revolutionary activity, focusing upon social equality, deviating from Hinduism. The rituals are also characterised and bound by religious beliefs that give them an alternative spiritual meaning.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, "Rituals", p. 98. Its scriptures cover basic elements and ideas throughout Hinduism. They refer to Shastras, Agamas, Vedas and Puranas.Akilattirattu Ammanai (T. Palaramachandran Nadar), p. 180. But address them all to be gone awry by the Advent of Vaikundar, from where Ayyavazhi scriptures forms negative ideas over all other traditions. Though Ayyavazhi shares many god-heads with Hinduism, it weaves unique ideology and power assumption for them. Ayyavazhi can be portrayed as a Hindu renaissance.T. Krishnanathan, Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum, pp.62–63. Ayyavazhi is viewed as a reform movement too,R. Ponnu, Vaikunda Swamikal Ore Avataram, pp.163–178. as it brought many social changes there in the Tamil and keralite society during the 19th century.
The religious structure evolved in the path of Ayyavazhi scriptures and, as a result, it transfigured itself as an alternative religio-cultural system in the social category. The Ayyavazhis addressed their system as "Path of God" with the phrase "Ayya Vazhi". On one hand, they believe that their tradition had come to replace all old traditions (religions), but on the other hand, they believe that Ayyavazhi is the synopsis of the world's religious knowledge. On one hand, they believe that Vaikundar unified all deities within him; on the other, as all the previous had gone awry by the advent of Vaikundar.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency,  "Ayya Vali – A New and Singular Religious Phenomenon" , p. 120. Apart from this, Ayyavazhi has separate theology, mythology, holy places, worship centres, and ethics of its own. thumb|right| 'The Great Masi Procession'  from Nagercoil to Swamithope
Though many new papers, academic researchers and some of its followers consider it as a separate religion, many of the followers are even of the opinion that this is but a Hindu sect rather than an autonomous religion.See [tpl]cite web|last = Bagavathikan |first = M. Raj |title = Ayya Vaikuntar|date = 10 February 1999|url = http://www.vaikunt.org/AyyaVaikuntar/index.htm| accessdate =13 January 2008 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080214072150/http://www.vaikunt.org/AyyaVaikuntar/index.htm| archivedate= 14 February 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] They indulge in the mystic practices of possessions and divinations similar to the tribal religions of Tamil Nadu. Also, many of its core beliefs are similar to some Hindu sects such as Advaita and Smartism.
Regarding demographics, Ayyavazhi followers are highly concentrated in South India though found across India, comparatively in less numbers. In Kanyakumari and Tirunelveli districts of Tamil Nadu, it is very hard to find a village without a worship centre of Ayyavazhi. Apart from the listings from the religious headquarters (though it is evident that Ayyavazhi followers are spread across the India from university papers)R. Ponnu, Sri Vaikunda Swamigal and the Struggle for Social Equality in South India, p. 100. there are no official figures for the number of followers of Ayyavazhi because they are considered Hindus in the census.

On January 6, 1854 it was sold to John Peterman, who later divided it into 4 parcels, the largest being [tpl]convert|120|acre|km2[/tpl].  Peterman sold the largest parcel, on which The Kingbridge Centre was built, to William McNair on March 6th, 1861 for $6,000.
In 1929 the farm was sold to the Toronto Company of the Girl Guides of Canada. After a series of repairs to the existing buildings, the camp was relocated to Hawkestone, Ontario.
The main facilities were originally built in 1989 by Murray Koffler, the founder of Shoppers Drug Mart and co-founder of Four Seasons Hotels. The site was first named King Ranch Health Spa and Fitness Resort, and was designed as a luxury spa facility. It opened in 1989 and operated until 1992, when it fell into receivership and was repossessed by its financier, The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC).  Without viable economic prospects, CIBC adapted the facility to become its "Leadership Centre".
In 1996, the secretive Bilderberg Group held its annual meeting here.
In 2001, the site was sold to John Abele, co-founder of Boston Scientific, who transformed it into its current use as a meeting and presentation venue.

The Sea Wolves is a 1980 war film starring Gregory Peck, Roger Moore and David Niven. The film is based on the book Boarding Party by James Leasor, which itself is based on a real incident which took place in World War II. The incident involved the Calcutta Light Horse's covert attack on 9 March 1943 against a German merchant ship, which had been transmitting information to U-boats from Mormugão Harbour in neutral Portugal's territory of Goa.

==Plot==

During World War II, German submarines are sinking thousands of tons of British merchant shipping. British intelligence, based in India, believes that information is being passed to the U-Boats by a radio transmitter hidden on board one of three German merchant ships interned in Portuguese Goa. Since Portugal is neutral, the ships cannot be attacked by conventional forces. The head of the Indian section of Special Operations Executive approaches a territorial unit of British expatriates, the Calcutta Light Horse, to carry out the mission on its behalf. They all volunteer - all are trained in military skills and keen to 'do their bit'.
Whilst the volunteers are trained, Stewart and Cartwright travel covertly to Goa. By a mixture of blackmail and bribery, they arrange diversions on the night of the raid. A party is to be held in the Governor's palace, a brothel will offer free entry to sailors from the German ships and a fiesta will be held. Stewart has a brief affair with Mrs.Cromwell, a mysterious and socially well-connected woman, who turns out to be a German agent and the main conduit for information. She is eventually killed by Stewart.
The raiding party sail around the coast in a decrepit barely seaworthy barge and set mines on the hull of the German ship. They then board, catching the depleted crew off-guard. Despite Pugh's order that there be no shooting, several German sailors are killed. The ship is set alight and the party withdraws, watching as the ship sinks.

==Historical basis==

The film notes in its closing credits that during the first 11 days of March 1943, the U-boats sank 12 Allied ships in the Indian Ocean. But, after the Light Horse raid on Goa, only one ship was lost in the remainder of the month.

==Cast==

The film reunited much of the cast and crew from 1978's The Wild Geese, including Roger Moore, Kenneth Griffith, Jack Watson, writer Reginald Rose, producer Euan Lloyd, director Andrew V. McLaglen, designer Syd Cain and composer Roy Budd. According to the documentary The Last of the Gentleman Producers, Lloyd says that he originally planned to reunite Moore with Wild Geese co-stars Richard Burton and Richard Harris as Pugh and Grice. Gregory Peck and David Niven had worked together on 1961's The Guns of Navarone, but where excluded from appearing in the 1978 sequel Force 10 from Navarone since it was felt they were too old to convincingly play military veterans. This movie made two years later disproved this theory. Incidental music is from The Warsaw Concerto

[[Ribbonism]]

CATEGORIES: Irish rebellions, Anti-Protestantism, Protestant-related controversies, Irish secret societies

Ribbonism, whose adherents were usually called Ribbonmen, was a 19th-century popular movement of Catholics in Ireland. It was active against landlords and their agents, and was ideologically and sometimes violently opposed to the Orange Order.

==History==

The Ribbon Society was principally an agrarian secret society, whose members consisted of rural Irish Catholics.Robert Kee, The Green Flag, 1972, p. 299 The society was formed in response to the miserable conditions in which the vast majority of tenant farmers and rural workers lived in the early 19th century in Ireland. Its objective was to prevent landlords from changing or evicting their tenants. Ribbonmen also attacked tithe and process servers, and later evolved the policy of Tenants' Rights.H. B. C. Pollard, Secret Societies of Ireland, Their Rise and Progress, 2003, pp. 34-37  The existence of "ribandmen" was recorded as early as 1817.The Times, 16 April 1817, Ireland. (From the Dublim Evening Post.), Lifford Assizes The name is derived from a green ribbon worn as a badge in a button-hole by the members.
Depending on the district, the society was variously known as the Fraternal Society, the Patriotic Association or the Sons of the Shamrock. The Ribbonmen's organisation was similar to that of the Whiteboys or the Defenders of earlier periods. They were organised in lodges, and during the 1820s were in contact with certain organisations of Radicals in England. 
The ideology of the Ribbonmen supported the Catholic Association and the political separation of Ireland from Great Britain, and the rights of the tenant as against those of the landlord.[tpl]Citation |last=Frazier |first=Adrian |title=George Moore, 1852–1933 |year=2000 |publisher=Yale University Press |publication-date=New Haven |pages=604 |isbn=0-300-08245-2[/tpl] The Ribbonmen were involved in violent (and sometimes deadly) riots with the Orange Order in the north of Ireland, and elsewhere used violence to resist paying tithes to the Protestant Church of Ireland.  As the agitation for Catholic Emancipation grew, the tension between Ribbonism and Orangeism increased.[tpl]Citation |editor-last=Wood |editor-first=Rev. James |editor-link=James Wood (encyclopaedist) |year=1907 |title =The Nuttall Encyclopædia[/tpl]
On 26 July 1813 the Battle of Garvagh in County Londonderry took place. Four hundred Catholic Ribbonmen attempted to destroy a tavern in Garvagh where the Orange Lodge met. They were armed with sticks and bludgeons, but Protestants were waiting inside armed with muskets and repelled them. Several of the Ribbonmen were killed and the rest fled.[tpl]cite web | title=Parades and Marches - Chronology 2: Historical Dates and Events| work=Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN)| url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/parade/chpa2.htm| accessdate=28 January 2010[/tpl] 
On 12 July 1830, Orange parades led to confrontations between Orangemen and Ribbonmen in Maghera and Castledawson in County Londonderry. Several Catholic homes were then burned by Protestants following these clashes. In November of the same year, ribbonmen attacked an Orange band, puncturing some of their drums. The Orangemen retaliated by burning the Catholic village of Maghery, County Armagh to the ground. 12 July 1849 saw the Battle of Dolly's Brae. Up to 1400 armed Orangemen marched from Rathfriland to Tollymore Park near Castlewellan, County Down. When 1000 armed Ribbonmen gathered, shots were fired, Catholic homes were burnt and about 80 Catholics killed.
Ribbonists were most active between 1835 and 1855 and in the Tithe War.

Richard Adelbert Lipsius (February 14, 1830, Gera, Thuringia – August 19, 1892, Jena, Thuringia) was a distinguished German Protestant theologian.[tpl]sfn|Wood|1907[/tpl]

==Biography==

Richard Adelbert Lipsius was the son of K. H. A. Lipsius (d. 1861), who was rector of the school of St Thomas at Leipzig, was born at Gera on the 14 February 1830. He studied at Leipzig, and eventually (1871) settled at Jena as professor ordinaries. He helped to found the "Evangelical Protestant Missionary Union" and the "Evangelical Alliance", and from 1874 took an active part in their management. He died at Jena on 19 August 1892.[tpl]sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=743[/tpl]

==Works==

Lipsius wrote principally on dogmatics and the history of early Christianity from a liberal and critical standpoint. A Neo-Kantian, he was to some extent an opponent of Albrecht Ritschl, demanding[tpl]sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=743[/tpl]
[tpl]quote|a connected and consistent theory of the universe, which shall comprehend the entire realm of our experience as a whole. He rejects the doctrine of dualism in a truth, one division of which would be confined to "judgments of value", and be unconnected with our theoretical knowledge of the external world. The possibility of combining the results of our scientific knowledge with the declarations of our ethico-religious experience, so as to form a consistent philosophy, is based, according to Lipsius, upon the unity of the personal ego, which on the one hand knows the world scientifically, and on the other regards it as the means of realizing the ethico-religious object of its life |Otto Pfleiderer.[tpl]sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=743[/tpl][/tpl]
This, in part, is Lipsius's attitude in Philosophie und Religion (1885). In his Lehrbuch der evang.-prot. Dogmatik (1876; 3rd ed., 1893) he deals in detail with the doctrines of "God", "Christ", "Justification" and the "Church".[tpl]sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=743[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Comtism, Alumni of Wadham College, Oxford, Fellows of Wadham College, Oxford, 1818 births, 1899 deaths, People educated at Rugby School

Richard Congreve (4 September 1818 – 5 July 1899) was an English philosopher, one of the leading figures in the specifically religious interpretation of Auguste Comte's form of positivism. In that capacity he founded the London Positivist Society in 1867 and the Comtist Church of Humanity in 1878.Nineteenth-century English Religious Traditions: Retrospect and Prospect By Denis G. Paz He also wrote political tracts.

==Life and education==

He was born at Leamington Hastings, Warwickshire, on 4 September 1818. He was educated under Dr. Arnold at Rugby,[tpl]cite web |last=Mitchell|first=A.T.|title=Rugby School Register 1842-1874 |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/rugbyschoolregis02rugbuoft/rugbyschoolregis02rugbuoft_djvu.txt|accessdate=1 September 2011 |year=1912[/tpl] and at the university of Oxford, where he gained a scholarship at Wadham College, Oxford, matriculated on 23 February 1837, graduated B.A. (first class in literæ humaniores) in 1840, and proceeded M.A. in 1843. 
He came to Oxford a typical pupil of Dr. Arnold, high-minded, intensely earnest, and latitudinarian in his theological opinions. 
His success in the schools was naturally followed by election to a fellowship at his college; he was a master at Rugby from 1845 to 1848,; he resided as tutor for the next ten years. His influence upon his pupils is said to have been singularly bracing, morally as well as intellectually.[tpl]sfn|Rigg|1901[/tpl]
The turning-point in Congreve's life was a visit to Paris shortly after the French Revolution of 1848. He there met Barthélemy St.-Hilaire and Auguste Comte, and the influence of Comte stayed with him. He adopted the entire positivist system, including the religious cult. He resigned his fellowship (1855), left Oxford, and soon afterwards founded the positivist community in London. 
Congreve studied medicine, and in 1866 was admitted member of the Royal College of Physicians. In the early days of the positivist movement he took the major part in the establishment of the propaganda in Chapel Street, Lamb's Conduit Street, London, and for some years worked harmoniously with Mr. Frederic Harrison and other leading positivists. In 1878, however, he issued a circular (17 June) in which he claimed for himself an authority independent of Pierre Laffitte, Comte's principal executor, and as such then universally acknowledged as the head of the positivist community. Some positivists joined him; others, among whom were Frederic Harrison, John Henry Bridges, Edward Spencer Beesly, Vernon Lushington, and James Cotter Morison, remained in union with Laffitte, and opened Newton Hall, Fetter Lane, London, as their place of meeting.[tpl]sfn|Rigg|1901[/tpl]
Congreve used the freedom which this separation allowed him to elaborate a higher form of ritual. Despite failing health, he maintained his unfashionable opinions, and kept up his priestly functions, until his death, at Hampstead, on 5 July 1899.[tpl]sfn|Rigg|1901[/tpl]

==Family==

In 1856, he married Mary, daughter of J. Berry of Warwick.[tpl]sfn|Rigg|1901[/tpl]

Jaromír Weinberger (January 8, 1896 – August 8, 1967) was a Czech American composer.

==Biography==

Weinberger was born in Prague, from a family of Jewish origin. He heard Czech folksongs from time spent at his grandparents' farm as a youth.Kushner, David Z., "Jaromir Weinberger (1896-1967): From Bohemia to America" (Autumn 1988). American Music, 6 (3): pp. 293-313. He started to play the piano at age 5, and was composing and conducting by age 10. He began musical studies with Jaroslav Křička. Later teachers included Václav Talich and Rudolf Karel. He became a student at the Prague Conservatory at age 14, as a second-year student. There, he studied composition with Vítězslav Novák and Karel Hoffmeister. Later, at Leipzig, he studied with Max Reger and assumed into his own technique Reger's immense grasp of counterpoint. In September 1922, almost inexplicably, Weinberger moved to the United States where he took up a position as an instructor at Cornell University.[tpl]cite web|url=http://orelfoundation.org/index.php/composers/article/jaromir_weinberger|title=OREL Foundation. Jaromir Weinberger. (2008) Michael Beckerman. [/tpl] Between 1922 and 1926 he was professor of composition at the Ithaca Conservatory (currently Music School of Ithaca College), New York.  
When he returned to Czechoslovakia he was appointed director of the National Theater in Bratislava, and later received appointments in Eger,  Hungary, and Prague.  In 1926 Weinberger completed Švanda Dudák (Schwanda the Bagpiper) which became one of the most popular operatic works between the wars, with thousands of performances in hundreds of theaters including the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. His operetta Frühlingsstürme was first performed at the Theatre im Admiralspalast in Berlin on 19 January 1933 with Jarmila Novotna and Richard Tauber in the leading roles. Mary Losseff took over from Novotna in February, but the show was closed down by the Nazis in March.
Although none of his subsequent European works captured audiences as Švanda Dudák had, such pieces as the Passacaglia for orchestra and organ, Six Bohemian Dances for violin and piano, the opera The Outcasts of Poker Flat and a grand oratorio Christmas reveal a versatile composer, making use of the widest variety of materials and approaches.
In 1939, after extensive travels to the United States, Bratislava, and Vienna, he fled his native country to escape the Nazis and settled in New York State, teaching there and in Ohio. He wrote a number of works on commission from American orchestras. He became an American citizen in 1948.
During the 1950s, Weinberger moved to St. Petersburg, Florida. In later life, he developed cancer of the brain. This, together with money worries and the neglect of his music, prompted him to take a lethal drug overdose in August 1967. His wife, Hansi Lemberger Weinberger (also known as Jane), survived him until her death on 31 July 1968.
In 2004 Czech pianist Tomáš Víšek and cellist František Brikcius organized a tour celebrating Weinberger's work.

==Major works==

Weinberger composed over 100 works, including operas, operettas, choral works, and works for orchestra. However, the only one which is still remembered is the opera Schwanda the Bagpiper (Švanda dudák), a worldwide success after its première in 1927. The opera is still performed occasionally, and the Polka and Fugue from it is often heard in a concert version. It was once considered by the artists of the Walt Disney studio to be made into a Fantasia segment for Fantasia 2000, but lost out to Shostakovich's Piano Concerto No. 2 in F major, in the form of Hans Christian Andersen's "The Steadfast Tin Soldier".
It can be argued that Weinberger used a varied musical language.  His studies in Prague and Leipzig stressed formal control and contrapuntal mastery; his teachers, Křička, Novák and Reger were concerned with a certain professional polish and control, but they were also somewhat playful, and that combination can be found in Weinberger's works.  These were aspects of his output that alternately received critical acclaim (when they were regarded as somehow genuine) and also set the composer up for a good deal of criticism (when they were thought to be either too automatic or insufficiently profound).  It is fair to say that, with the exception of Švanda Dudák, Weinberger frustrated his critics even as he pleased them.

Daniel Brian Bylsmahttp://www.danbylsma.com/biography.htm ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|aɪ|l|z|m|ə[/tpl] [tpl]respell|BYLZ|mə[/tpl]; born September 19, 1970) is a former professional hockey player who is currently the head coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League (NHL) and the United States men's national ice hockey team. He was hired to be the Penguins' head coach on February 15, 2009, replacing Michel Therrien. Prior to coaching the Penguins, he played as a forward in the NHL and coached in the American Hockey League (AHL). He was drafted in the sixth round (109th Overall) of the 1989 NHL Entry Draft, by the Winnipeg Jets.  On June 12, 2009, four months after becoming head coach in Pittsburgh, Bylsma led the Penguins to their third Stanley Cup Championship winning in 7 games over the Detroit Red Wings.

==Early life==

During his high-school days, Bylsma was a standout in many sports, including golf, baseball, and ice hockey. Bylsma graduated from Western Michigan Christian High School where he won the Class D golf individual championship as a freshman. He also played baseball and was the starting left fielder as a freshman on Christian's 1985 State championship team. In his senior year, he was a member of the all-state all-class "Dream Team" (the best player at each position in the state – all classes), and won many regional baseball honors. 
Bylsma played amateur hockey in Muskegon Junior Hockey, Norton Shores Recreational Leagues, and Grand Rapids GRAHA before playing Junior "B" hockey in Canada for the St. Marys Lincolns and the Oakville Blades of the Ontario Hockey Association. Bylsma went on to play college hockey at Bowling Green State University from 1988–1992 and was drafted by the Winnipeg Jets in his freshman year. He was twice selected to the Central Collegiate Hockey Association All Academic Team and once earned Honorable Mention. He was a Bowling Green Scholar Athlete all four years and won the Jack Gregory Award for the highest grade point average on the team in his Sophomore season and the Howard Brown Coaches' Award for excellence in his Senior year. Bylsma is one of few players in the CCHA to have scored a short handed goal while his team was two men short.

==Professional playing career==

Despite being drafted by the Winnipeg Jets, Bylsma never played a game for them, and was signed by the Los Angeles Kings in the summer of 1994. During the 1994–95 labor stoppage, Bylsma earned the nickname "Disco Dan". The nickname was adopted by teammates while playing for a minor league team in Phoenix. Veteran goaltender Byron Dafoe already went by Bylsma's former moniker of "Bysie" so the name "Disco Dan" was given due to Bylsma's penchant for dancing in the locker room.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09104/962620-61.stm | title = NHL Playoffs: Bylsma's success reads like fish story | publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | last = Anderson | first = Shelly | date = 2009-04-14 | accessdate = 2009-06-19[/tpl]
He played parts of five seasons for the Kings, acting as a defensive forward. In his first season, when he played only four games for the Kings, he was captain of their International Hockey League (IHL) affiliate, the Phoenix Roadrunners. He also played for the Long Beach Ice Dogs, who were the Kings' IHL affiliate after the Roadrunners folded in 1997. Bylsma played 95 American Hockey League (AHL) games with the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks, the Lowell Lock Monsters, the Springfield Falcons, the Albany River Rats, the Moncton Hawks and the Rochester Americans, and reached the Calder Cup Finals in 1994.
Signed as a free agent by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the summer of 2000, Bylsma was a steadying influence on a rebuilding Anaheim team, and was made an alternate captain.  In his second season, he set a career high in points (17).
Bylsma struggled his entire career to stay in the NHL, mostly due to a lack of natural offensive ability (his primary role in the NHL had always been penalty killing). Injuries took a toll in later years, and before being put on waivers in January 2004, Bylsma missed 31 games due to knee surgery. He retired from playing following the 2003–04 season.

==Coaching career==

Bylsma served as an assistant coach with the AHL's Cincinnati Mighty Ducks (2004–05) and the NHL's New York Islanders (2005–06). During the 2008–09 season, Bylsma coached the Penguins' AHL affiliate Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins.
On February 15, 2009, with the Pittsburgh Penguins struggling to make the playoffs, the Penguins organization announced that it had relieved head coach Michel Therrien of his duties and had promoted Bylsma to serve as interim head coach of the team.[tpl]cite news | url = http://penguins.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=409456 | title =  				Dan Bylsma Named Interim Head Coach of Pittsburgh Penguins | publisher=Pittsburgh Penguins | date = 2009-02-15 | accessdate = 2009-06-19[/tpl] At 38, he was the youngest head coach in the NHL at the time.

Bylsma was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's most outstanding coach for the 2010–2011 season due to the Penguins still being a contender for the Stanley Cup without his two star players Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin.

Michael Davis Pratt (born March 10, 1957) known professionally as Jim White, is a Southern American singer-songwriter and guitarist. White's music can be loosely described as alternative country, but veers off in different, sometimes experimental directions with occasional nods[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]
to Tom Waits and the literary narratives of Flannery O'Connor, Cormac McCarthy, and Harry Crews.

==Early life==

White was born in California but moved to Pensacola, Florida at the age of 5 .He was influenced in his childhood by gospel music.[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p128338|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Biography |accessdate=2008-06-01 |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |publisher=Allmusic [/tpl] According to various sources, he has been a comedian, a fashion model, a boxer, a preacher, a professional surfer, and a New York cab driver.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/jim-white.shtml |title=Jim White Interview |accessdate=2008-06-01 |last=White |first=Jim |coauthors=BBC Four |date=2004-06-22 |work=BBC Four Documentaries |publisher=BBC [/tpl] Before embarking on a music career, White attended film school at New York University. Soon after finishing his lengthy thesis at the university, White entered a self-described "deep hole of sickness and depression and poverty."[tpl]cite journal |last=White |first =Jim |coauthors=Henderson, Steve |title=Jim White – The Triste Interview |journal=Triste Magazine |issue=4 |url=http://www.triste.co.uk/white.htm |accessdate=2008-06-01 [/tpl] However, during a party organized by film school friends, White began to perform, and began writing material for an album soon afterward.

==Musical career and performances==

White's live shows, particularly when touring solo, can be characterized as off-beat, blending his playlist with open discussion with the audience, anecdotal storytelling derived from his own life experiences, all of which is typically humorous and insightful,with a deep sense of his feeling for the broken beauty of humanity. He has stated during shows that ultimately he wishes to return to the academic field, particularly as a professor, rather than continue as a professional, touring musician. Much of this is due to his family life, which he has stated takes priority in his life and is the reason he does not like touring very much. His sister, Katherine Pratt, teaches at Loyola Law School.
White's band has no fixed lineup, but regularly includes musicians such as Dan Nettles (Electric Guitar); Peter Alvanos, Robby Handley, Steve Bishop Maples (Bass); Rob McMaken (Dulcimer, Acoustic Guitar, Mandolin), Marlon Patton (Drums) and Mark Tulk (Keys).

[[MTV Unplugged (Mariah Carey EP)]]

MTV Unplugged is an extended play (EP) and live album by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey, released in the United States on June 2, 1992 by Columbia Records. Following the success of Carey's previous two albums and the growing critical commentary on her lack of concert tours and unsubstantial televised performances, Sony BMG organised a performance show at the Kaufman Astoria Studios, New York on March 16, 1992. The show, titled MTV Unplugged, originally aired on MTV to help promote Carey's album Emotions, as well as help shun critics who deemed Carey a possible studio artist. However, after its success, the show was released to the public as an EP, with an accompanying VHS titled MTV Unplugged +3.
Upon release, the EP garnered generally positive reviews from music critics, many of whom complimented Carey's vocals. Commercially, the album was a success, peaking at number three on the Billboard 200, and was certified three times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of over three million copies within the United States. Additionally, the EP experienced strong success in several international markets, such as the Netherlands and New Zealand, where it reached number one and was certified double platinum. MTV Unplugged peaked within the top five in the United Kingdom, and in the top ten in Australia and Canada.
"I'll Be There" was chosen as the lead single from the album. Due to its critical success up until that point, it was released one month before its parent EP, eventually becoming Carey's sixth chart topper in the United States, and one of the few songs to do so by two different acts. Globally, the song was successful, topping the singles charts in the charts in Canada, the Netherlands and New Zealand, as well as attaining the top five position in Ireland and the United Kingdom. After its success, "If It's Over", a song from Carey's second studio effort Emotions was released, due to its exposure on the show and EP.

==Background==

After the release of Carey's second studio album, Emotions (1991), critics began wondering whether Carey would finally embark on a worldwide tour, having not toured to promote her self-titled debut album.[tpl]harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=70[/tpl] Although Carey had done several sporadic award show appearances, as well as television program performances, critics began accusing Carey of being a studio artist, not capable of delivering or replicating the same quality vocals live, especially her whistle register. During several televised interviews, Carey addressed the accusations, claiming that she did not tour out of fear of the long travel times and distances, as well as the strain on her voice performing her songs back-to-back. However, in hopes of putting any claims of her being a manufactured artist to rest, Carey and Walter Afanasieff decided to book an appearance on MTV Unplugged, a television program aired by MTV. The show's purpose was to present name artists, and feature them "unplugged" or stripped of studio equipment. While live, the show allowed several musicians and back up vocalists, while recorded in an acoustic setting.[tpl]harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=71[/tpl] The issues Carey faced once the show was booked was the content; she didn't know what material to present at the intimate concert. While Carey felt strongly of her more soulful and powerful songs, it was decided that her most popular content to that point would be included. Days prior to the show's taping, Carey and Afanasieff thought of adding a cover version of an older song, in order to provide something different and unexpected. They chose "I'll Be There", a song made popular by The Jackson 5 in 1970, rehearsing it few times before the night of the show.

==Synopsis==

Carey's performance was recorded on March 16, 1992 at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York.[tpl]harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=72[/tpl] The show featured a number of musicians, back-up vocalists and just a crew of ten, for filming and recording. Directed by Larry Jordan, who previously worked with Carey on the music video for "Someday". Dana Jon Chapelle was chosen as the sound mixer, having worked with Carey on her previous two studio albums. The show began with the song "Emotions" Carey entered the studio dressed in a black jacket and matching pants and boots. Prior to the song's studio introduction, Carey opened the song with an impromptu gospel and a cappella number, eventually leading to the song's chorus led by David Cole. After the song, Carey introduced the band and staff; to her left was a four-piece string section with Belinda Whitney Barnett, Cecilia Hobbs-Gardner, Wince Garvey and Laura Corcos, while San Shea played the harpsichord and harmonium. The show's rhythm section was led by Gigi Conway on the drums, Randy Jackson on bass, Vernon Black on guitar, and Sammy Figueroa and Ren Klyce, both percussionists. Additionally, Carey had ten background singers on stage, led by Trey Lorenz and Patrique McMillan. The next song on the set-list was "If It's Over", a collaboration with Carole King. Walter Afanasieff replaced Cole on the piano, during which time a set of five male musicians were brought on stage.[tpl]harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=73[/tpl] They were Lew Delgado, baritone saxophone; Lenny Pickett, tenor saxophone; George Young, alto saxophone; Earl Gardner, trumpet; and Steve Turre, trombone. They had been present during Carey's live performance of the song on Saturday Night Live a few months prior. As Carey introduced the song, she said "this next song I wrote with one of my idols, Carole King", beginning the performance shortly after. For "Someday", Cole returned to the stage, replacing Afanasieff on the keyboard.[tpl]harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=74[/tpl] During the song, Carey would often place her index finger over her left ear, especially while using the whistle register. She later explained to the audience that it would help her in hearing herself more precisely, something needed to properly execute a higher ranged note. Once again, as Carey began "Vision of Love", her "first single ever", Afansieff swapped positions with Cole.[tpl]harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=75[/tpl] The performance varied heavily from the studio version, as it was more low key and only used voices in a cappella form, without any heavy instrumentation. Prior to beginning the fifth song on the set-list, "Make It Happen", Afanasieff shared the organ with Cole, playing the bass while the latter handled the treble. After the song began, the back-up began "piling their vocals" over Carey's, according to author Chris Nickson, and allowed the song to attain a more "churchy feel". He felt the song was superior to the studio version, due to its stripped performance and vocals:
 
 "The roughness of this version succeeded in a way the recorded version on 'Emotions' could never manage. In the sterile atmosphere of a studio, where perfection, technology, and overdubbing were the rules, spontaneity had no place. On the stage, it was valued, and this performance had it. Everyone pushed everyone just a little further, to create something wonderful, and judging by the response, the audience realized it, as did Mariah when the song was finished."

Soon after completing "Make It Happen", Carey eagerly presented the final song on the set list, "I'll Be There". The way the song was arranged, Carey took Michael Jackson's lead, while Trey Lorenz sang the second lead, originally sung by Jermaine Jackson.[tpl]harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=76[/tpl] After performing the sung alongside a very simple arrangement and minimal instrumentals, the back-up singers began humming to the tune of "Can't Let Go", leading Carey to present "another final" song for the show. Several days after the concert, Carey sat down with Melinda Newman from Billboard, telling her of the experience recording the show, as well as her view on it from a creative perspective. She said "Unplugged taught me a lot about myself because I tend to nitpick everything I do and make it a bit too perfect because I'm a perfectionist. I'll always go over the raw stuff, and now I've gotten to the point where I understand the raw stuff is usually better."

==Release==

Originally, MTV planned to air the show several times during April 1992, it was normal for MTV Unplugged sessions to air around six times during the month of release, before being archived.[tpl]harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=78–79[/tpl] Carey's version was met with critical acclaim and extended popularity, leading to it being shown more often than usual. Fans from around the United States made multiple requests for the show to be aired on television, and by the end of April 1992, Carey's episode of MTV Unplugged had aired over three-times as much as an average episode would. The concert's success tempted Sony officials to use it as some form of an album. However, Carey and Afansieff were already making headway on a new album set tentatively for release in 1993. This being so, Sony decided to release it as an EP, selling for a reduced price due to its shorter length.

===Video===

After the success of the EP's lead single "I'll Be There", Sony chose to release not only the EP, but a VHS accompaniment package; a video of the actual concert titled MTV Unplugged +3. Aside from featuring the seven song's performed at Kaufman Astoria Studios, it held three music videos; "Can't Let Go", "Make It Happen", and a rare remix version and video of "Emotions". The video peaked atop the Billboard video chart, and was certified platinum by the RIAA, denoting shipments of over 100,000 units throughout the United States.

==Critical reception==

MTV Unplugged garnered generally positive reviews from music critics. Allmusic editor Shawn M. Haney gave the album three out of five stars, praising Carey's vocals as well as her cover of "I'll Be There".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/mtv-unplugged-ep-r59262/review|title=Mariah Carey: MTV Unplugged|last=Haney|first=Shawn M.|work=Allmusic|publisher=All Media Guide. Rovi Corporation|accessdate=2011-03-30[/tpl] Haney wrote "Gradually, the power and esteem of these tales lift to new heights and remain at a peak with the breathtaking, moment-making performance of "I'll Be There," a charming song first cut by the Jackson 5." Writing for the St. Petersburg Times, Sabrina Miller called Carey an "artiste" and wrote "Programs like MTV Unplugged showcase talent like hers with an exclamation point."[tpl]cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/54262151.html?dids=54262151:54262151&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Aug+07%2C+1992&author=SABRINA+MILLER&pub=St.+Petersburg+Times&desc=Mariah+Carey+a+hit+on+MTV+production+Series%3A+AUDIO+FILES%3B+AUDIO+REVIEW&pqatl=google|title=Mariah Carey a hit on MTV production Series|last=Miller|first=Sabrina|work=St. Petersburg Times|publisher=Times Publishing Company|date=1992-08-07|accessdate=2011-03-30[/tpl] Journalist and writer from The New York Times Jon Pareles branded the performance "shrewed," and claimed Carey's cover of I'll be There" "set off fireworks."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/13/arts/review-pop-venturing-outside-the-studio-mariah-carey-proves-her-mettle.html|title=Review/Pop; Venturing Outside the Studio, Mariah Carey Proves Her Mettle|last=Pareles|first=Jon|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=1993-12-13|accessdate=2011-01-26[/tpl] A writer for Entertainment Weekly called the show a "vocal Tour de force," and wrote "in addition to her breathtaking pipes, she has developed a commanding stage presence."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,312805,00.html|title=Carey On|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time.

The song debuted at number thirteen on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Carey's highest debut on the chart at the time. After four weeks, the song topped the chart, becoming Carey's sixth number one in the United States, and spending two weeks there. Its success across the globe was strong, peaking at number one on the singles charts in Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, and reached number two and three in the United Kingdom and Ireland, respectively.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.2006&type=1&interval=50&PHPSESSID=4dp17sl7hp9qmhhj3vmcenr836|title=Top Singles – Volume 56, No. 2, July 11, 1992|publisher=RPM|date=1992-07-11|accessdate=2010-09-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Mariah+Carey&titel=I%27ll+Be+There+%5BUnplugged%5D&cat=s|title=Mariah Carey: I'll Be There|language=German|work=Dutch Top 40|publisher=Hung Medien|accessdate=2010-08-20[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://charts.org.nz/showitem.asp?interpret=Mariah+Carey&titel=I%27ll+Be+There+%5BUnplugged%5D&cat=s|title=Mariah Carey: I'll Be There|work=New Zealand Singles Chart|publisher=Hung Medien|accessdate=2010-08-20[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irishcharts.ie/search/placement|title=Search The Charts|work=The Irish Charts|publisher=Irish Recorded Music Association|accessdate=2010-10-23[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/mariah%20carey/|title=UK Charts > Mariah Carey|publisher=The Official Charts Company.

[[PANOSE]]

CATEGORIES: Classification systems, Digital typography

The PANOSE System is a method for classifying typefaces solely on their visual characteristics, developed by Benjamin Bauermeister. It can be used to identify an unknown font from a sample image or to match a known font to its closest visual neighbor from a font pool. The word "PANOSE" is composed of letters taken from the six classes in which the creator of the system organized the Latin alphabet.Yannis Haralambous, Fonts & Encodings, O'Reilly Media, 2007, p. 424. ISBN 0-596-10242-9.

==History==

The original PANOSE System was developed in 1985 by Benjamin Bauermeister. In 1988, it was published by Van Nostrand Reinhold Company Inc. under the title A Manual of Comparative Typography: The PANOSE System. This initial version of the PANOSE system consisted of seven classification categories and was based on subjective visual parameters.
In 1990, the Weight category was added, and the Arm Style category was split off from the Stroke Variation category, bringing the number of classification categories to 9. Objective classification criteria were also added at this time.
In 1991, the Family Kind category was added, completing the PANOSE 1.0 definition. 
In 1992, there were attempts made to classify Han ideographic typefaces, which allows applications to suggests the most appropriate Latin typeface to match a given Han ideographic typeface. Transliteral mapping could also be used to match between, for example, decorative or script faces and text equivalents.
In 1993, Mapper Application Interface (MAI) was developed. PANOSE 2.0 was also released in the same year, which is the basis for Hewlett Packard's Infinifont font synthesis technology.
PANOSE was incorporated into a variety of digital font metadata tags in 1992 by ElseWare Corporation. The classification system, its matching algorithms reference databases, classification parameters, and trademarks were purchased by Hewlett Packard in 1995. A font synthesis engine named Infinifont was also purchased by Hewlett Packard at that time.

==Revisions==

===1.0===

It was published in 1988. A PANOSE classification number consists of 10 concatenated values. Each value from a given category was computed from a specific visual metric, such as the weight of the font and the presence or absence of serifs. Special values "Any" (0) and "No Fit" (1) exist for every category, which have specific meanings to the mapper. "Any" means match that digit with any available digit, which allows the mapper to handle distortable typefaces. "No Fit" means that the item being classified does not fit within the present system.
The standard classifies fonts in following categories in following order:

====Latin Text categories====

====Latin Hand Written categories====

====Latin Decoratives categories====

====Latin Symbol categories====

====Example====

For example, the PANOSE digits for Times New Roman are:

===2.0===

The system stores actual measurement data under the Rich Font Description (RFD) rather than bucketing it, which allows the matching system to use mathematical distance rather than penalty tables. It is designed for distortable font technologies (e.g.: Multi Master fonts). The system offers multiple methods for distortable fonts.
The original classification system was changed from a bucket-based system to an arithmetic system (except the Family from PANOSE 1.0 and derivatives), and was expanded to following categories:
Each PANOSE 2.0 category value is a signed 16-bit number (from −32,768 to 32,767; only ranges between −10,000 and 10,000 are defined), where value zero (0) is considered to be the "normal" for the digit. For example, digit zero for the weight represents medium weight. The "any" value from PANOSE 1.0 is translated to a "don't care" parameter and is replaced by the more comprehensive distortable font descriptions.
The Family category is replaced by Class and Genre, where Class indicates a font's language and character set, where Genre indicates text faces, display faces, symbol faces, and so on. PANOSE matching software is designed to match fonts with different Class, but same Genre. The same Genre can have different meaning in different Class, so the matching heuristic decides the closeness of fonts based on adjusted values based on Class, rather than raw PANOSE values within the fonts themselves.

==PANOSE Classification Procedures==

Classification Procedures are objective measurement techniques used to assign a PANOSE number to a font.

==PANOSE Mapper software==

The PANOSE Mapper software determines the closest possible font match on any given system by comparing the PANOSE numbers of the requested and available fonts. The individual PANOSE digits are compared, weighted by their typographic importance, and summed to provide a numerical visual distance. Typographic importance is derived by assigning weights to each digit; for example, a font's weight (regular, bold, demibold, etc.) is more important than its contrast (difference between thick and thin strokes).

==Standardizations==

PANOSE 1.0 table is supported in TrueType font format.
PANOSE 2.0 is used in ElseWare Corporation's Infinifont parametric font generation system.
In 1996, during the W3C's draft process for CSS1, Hewlett Packard proposed a PANOSE syntax extension for font substitution. It was not included in the final CSS1 recommendation partly because of licensing concerns. Although Hewlett Packard Co. is not interested in profiting from PANOSE, it will negotiate licenses on a time and materials basis.PANOSE: An Ideal Typeface Matching System for the Web
PANOSE 1.0 is supported in SVG since version 1.0 in the font-face element under panose-1 attribute.20.8.3 The 'font-face' element In CSS2, it is used in the panose-1 property,15.3.6 Descriptors for Matching: 'panose-1', 'stemv', 'stemh', 'slope', 'cap-height', 'x-height', 'ascent', and 'descent' which was removed in CSS2.1, and was reintroduced in CSS3 module: Web Fonts specifications.2.6.

CATEGORIES: Racing formulas, Formula Ford, Motorsport categories in Australia

Formula Ford is an entry-level class of single seater, open-wheel formula racing. The various championships held across the world form an important step for many prospective Formula One drivers. Formula Ford has traditionally been regarded as the first major stepping stone into formula racing after karting. The series typically sees professional career minded drivers enter alongside amateurs and enthusiasts. Success in Formula Ford can lead directly to other junior formulae such as a Formula Renault 2.0 or even an F3 seat.
Formula Ford is not a one-make championship.  It allows freedom of chassis design, engine build and numerous technical items of specification on the car. This opens the door to many chassis manufacturers, large and small. Many other single-seater formulae impose fixed specifications. Only two other professional single seater racing formulae in the world offer the same freedom of chassis and engine build: Formula Three and Formula One.

==History==

The origins of Formula Ford began in the early 1960s, where motor racing schools such as The Jim Russell school and Motor Racing Stables featured single seat Formula Junior and Formula 3-like machines from world class constructors like  Cooper and Lotus. Many aspiring Formula 1 stars looked to these schools in the hope of learning the craft and also looking the part. However, although there was no shortage of aspiring drivers, these schools had much trouble avoiding bankruptcy. The 1 litre Formula 3 engines, the 1.1 litre Coventry Climax FJ and later the Ford Anglia 105E, cost around £3,000 at the time in addition to the Dunlop racing tires which cost £80 a set. Furthermore, these engines were incredibly fragile to boot, meaning these engines had a tendency to self-destruct. All these factors contributed to a steep maintenance and upkeep cost of these schools.[tpl]cite book|last=Nickless|first=Steve|title=The Anatomy & Development of the Formula Ford Race Car|location=USA[/tpl]
In 1963, Geoff Clarke; the owner of Motor Racing Stables, moved his racing school to the Brands Hatch circuit. This brought him in contact with John Webb; Managing Director of Developments at Brands Hatch. At about this time, two of the school’s Lotus Formula Junior chassis were fitted with a stock 1498cc Ford pushrod engine as featured in the then-recently introduced Cortina GT sedan. The 1500 Cortina, with its sensational reliability and horsepower output fairly close to “F3 proper” proved a resounding success in the school. The earliest experiments with radial tires bore fruit as well: the students of the day didn’t care that these weren’t the racing engines or racing tires, just that the cars were equal.[tpl]cite book|last=North|first=Simon|title=Formula Ford a 20-Year Success Story|year=1987|publisher=Brands Hatch Publications|location=Kent, England[/tpl]
At an informal meeting at the December 1966 racing car show day at Olympia, John Webb and Geoff Clarke were discussing the possibility of building a fleet of identical open wheel race cars based on the success of combining the Ford power plant and road wheels, radial tires, and Formula junior style chassis. Not only would they make ideal school cars, but would also provide a new entry level formula for a race series. They felt if they called it “Formula Ford” they could get backing from Ford itself. Webb was on the phone the next day to Ford competition manager Henry Taylor, who agreed to provide Clarke and MRS with 54 Cortina GT engines at £50 each (£15 below retail). Webb also approached the Royal Automobile Club's competition director, to establish rules for this new class. Late in 1967, Ford announced the new Formula Ford class to the world.[tpl]cite book|last=Hodges|first=David|title=A-Z of Formula Racing Cars|year=1990|publisher=Brands Bay View Books Ltd.|location=Devon, England[/tpl]
Geoff Clarke then set about approaching existing race car constructors to build the first Formula Fords.  Both Bruce McLaren and Jack Brabham turned down the idea; Colin Chapman however dusted off the then obsolete Lotus 31 Chassis and reinvented it as the Lotus 51.  
He agreed to provide the first of two 25 car batches at £850 per car. The only stipulation Chapman had was that a Renault gear box was used. This proved to be fundamental weak point in the drive train. Difficulty with the Renault transmission resulted in a failure to continue with the second batch of cars for MRS.
Jim Russell approached Colin Chapman to supply Formula Ford cars for his own school. Chapman insisted Russell match Clarke’s 50 car order; Russell would only commit to 10 cars so the deal fell through. Russell then approached Allan Taylor who built the Alexis car and a deal was struck to jointly produce the Russell-Alexis. This car had the Hewland racing gear box which made the car more expensive (£999), but was more reliable and allowed interchangeable ratios.[tpl]cite book|last=Greenway|first=Norman|title=The Jim Russell Story|year=1999|publisher=Transport Bookman Publications Ltd.|location=Middlesex, England[/tpl]
The first standalone Formula Ford race took place at Brands Hatch on July 2, 1967. Of the 20 cars that competed, 10 were MRS Lotus 51’s, including the eventual winner, Ray Allan. The Russell-Alexis car demonstrated its superiority by winning its debut race in August 1967 and by 1968 54 Russell-Alexis had been sold. Based on this success Jim Russell opened 2 more racing schools in Britain, another in Canada, and another in the United States.
Chapman and his Lotus 51 did recover, replacing the troublesome Renault gear box with the Hewland unit, even claiming Jim Russell as a customer in 1968. 1968 also saw the debut of Meryln as a Formula Ford constructor, dominating sales for that year. Other new manufactures included Crosslé Car Company, Dulon, Elden Racing Cars, Hawke Racing Cars and Royale Racing Cars, together with existing constructors such as Brabham choosing to build a Formula Ford chassis.
As the production Ford Cortina engine evolved to a new 1600cc crossflow unit, so did the Formula Ford regulations. Increasing costs forced them to relax the £1,000 price ceiling on Formula Ford as blueprinting of the engine was now allowed.[tpl]cite book|last=Bingham|first=Phillip|title=Drive It! The Complete Book of Formula Ford|year=1984|publisher=Haynes Publishing Group|location=Somerset, England[/tpl]
Belgium hosted the first race outside England, in 1967. Formula Ford racing quickly spread across Europe and North America, with the first official Formula Ford race in the United States on March 23, 1969. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, Formula Ford had established itself as a direct path to a seat on a Formula 1 car, the highest level in open wheel motorsport. Australian Tim Schenken won over 2 dozen Formula Ford races in 1968, two years later he was driving a Formula 1 car for Frank Williams. Emerson Fittipaldi impressed during the 1970 Formula 1 Grand Prix Season after a short stint in Formula Ford. In 1970, he became the first Formula Ford graduate to win a Formula 1 Grand Prix. In 1972, he became the first Formula Ford graduate to win the Formula 1 World Championship.
Currently, Formula Ford racing exists in two main forms: National Series for aspiring 'career' drivers run around the world which have used the 1600 Duratec engine, (which replaced the heavier but not significantly more powerful Zetec engine in 2006), and for 2012 are beginning to adopt the new EcoBoost 1600 turbo engine; and a mainly amateur, club-racing series attracting serious enthusiasts using the now elderly 1600 Kent engine with which the formula ran from the mid-1960s to mid-1990s. Whatever the engine of the Formula Ford car, it has long provided a relatively inexpensive way for drivers to race purpose-built racecars. There are many Formula Ford 1600 series for drivers of the older Kent-powered cars.

==Formula Ford cars==

thumb|FFEA Van Diemen RF01 ChassisA Formula Ford car is one of the more distinctive-looking open-wheel race cars because it does not have wings to create aerodynamic downforce. In order to reduce cost and allow smaller manufacturers to produce their own design of chassis without prohibitive tooling costs, chassis are steel space frame, unlike the monocoques found in other types of single seater racing.  The more popular marques [tpl]As of|2012|lc=on[/tpl] were Van Diemen, Mygale and the Australian-built Spectrum, but smaller manufacturers such as Ray and Vector have had some success. Historical designers who have made a mark on the series have included: Titan, Lotus, Merlyn, Hawke, Citation, Swift, Euroswift, Elden, Reynard, Crosslé, Lola, Zink, Bowin, Royale, and Cooper Racing.
Top speeds in the National Class are easily as high as in the other Junior Formulae of BMW and Renault, but cornering speeds tend to be lower as Formula Ford cars lack the downforce-producing aerodynamic aids on the other cars; handling is therefore entirely down to mechanical grip, and the lack of wings ensures that cars following another are not aerodynamically disadvantaged, allowing some of the closest racing with plenty of overtaking. Series' rules may permit slick or treaded tires, generally supplied either by Dunlop or Avon. As the rules limit engine modifications, all cars are relatively equal and racing results tend to be close. Formula Fords allow suspension, damping, gearing and braking bias changes, but not aerodynamic options such as winged cars.
In 2012, new specifications and regulations were introduced, allowing the use of the new Ford EcoBoost engine along with improvements in chassis design. Unlike its predecessors, that used Naturally aspirated engines and manual gearboxes, the EcoBoost car utilizes power from a turbocharged engine and a sequential gearbox. The new car has 165PS, with identical engine calibration for every competitor's car. The chassis remains a steel spaceframe construction, with free chassis design open to all manufacturers. New to the car is its compliance with Formula Three safety standards, which involves mandatory crash structures, side-impact panels running the full height and length of the cockpit, an FIA-specified headrest and an extricable safety seat. In addition to the safety enhancements, some mandatory elements of bodywork shape have also been introduced.  These will define the shape, size and orientation of the sidepod air intakes and the roll-hoop cover.  By mandating these the frontal areas will be equalised between different manufacturers, removing the potential for significant aerodynamic advantage, making driving ability and the skills of engineers and designers in car set-up the major factors.

==Championships and events around the world==

Championships for Formula Fords are run in many countries around the world. The major series is the British Formula Ford Championship, however there are many other thriving series. Each run to essentially the same rules and regulations, with minor variations for local conditions.

===British Formula Ford Championship===

The British series is the main Formula Ford championship in the world. Created in 1976, the championship has run to all four generations of regulations and specifications. From 2013, the series will adopt the Formula Ford EcoBoost 200 specification, which will include an increase in the EcoBoost engine power, along with the new addition of a fully adjustable aerodynamic package which includes front and rear wings previously never seen before in the British championship.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.britishformulaford.co.uk/2013_Formula_Ford_Championship_Brochure.pdf|title=2013 Formula Ford Championship Brochure|work=RacingLine Limited|publisher=British Formula Ford Championship|accessdate=29 October 2012[/tpl] In late October 2012, the series organisers announced that from this season Duratec class cars will be ineligible for the championship, leaving only the EcoBoost class.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.brscc.co.uk/BRSCC-ANNOUNCES-PLANS-FOR-DURATEC-FORMULA-FORD|title=BRSCC ANNOUNCES PLANS FOR DURATEC FORMULA FORD|work=BRSCC|publisher=BRSCC|date=29 October 2012|accessdate=30 October 2012[/tpl] The series will also move back to supporting the BTCC.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.btcc.net/html/generalnews_detail.php?id=3211|title=Formula Ford returns in 2013|work=British Touring Car Championship|publisher=TOCA|date=12 October 2012|accessdate=12 October 2012[/tpl]
Several former drivers of the British championship have become successful in Formula One, including Eddie Irvine and Anthony Davidson, whilst Formula Ford champions Ayrton Senna and Jenson Button also went on to win the Formula One Drivers' Championship.

===Formula Ford Festival===

For many years the highlight of the Formula Ford season was the Formula Ford Festival at Brands Hatch, England. Entries of several hundred cars from all over the Formula Ford world were common into the 1990s, with racers competing in knockout heats to decide the grid for a grand final. Entries later declined, and later Festivals struggled to attract more than 40-50 cars, enough for two heats and a final dash. More "historic" FF1600 cars had been turning up for the supporting races than contemporary Zetecs, however in 2006 the Festival saw the Duratec engine for the first time thereby having a final for all 3 marques at one meeting for the first time. The Walter Hayes Trophy now recognises the continuing interest in 1600cc 'Kent' Formula Ford and attracted over 150 entries in 2006, including several drivers who more commonly compete in much more senior formulae.

===Formula Ford EuroCup===

The Formula Ford EuroCup, known originally as the European Formula Ford Championship, is the current incarnation of a pan-European championship for Formula Ford competitors, last held previously in 2001. The 2011 series was aimed at giving drivers experience at European race circuits. Three national Formula Ford Championships are involved in the revived championship, these being the British, Benelux and Scandinavian championships.Dunlop MSA Formula Ford Championship GB :: 22/11/2010 While individual events nominate a winner, there is no overarching point score to declare a series champion.

===Australian Formula Ford Championship===

The Australian Formula Ford Championship is a Confederation of Australian Motor Sport sanctioned national motor racing title for drivers of Formula Ford racing cars. It has been held annually since 1970, originally as a national series, and later as the 'Driver-to-Europe' series. The series was upgraded to Australian Championship status in 1993 and has been known officially as the Australian Formula Ford Championship since that year. The series moved from the first-generation Kent engine to the third-generation Mazda-sourced Ford Duratec engine in 2006.

===U.S. F2000 National Championship===

The U.S. F2000 National Championship powered by Mazda is an American racing series using the American variation of the Formula Ford formula, Formula Ford 2000, that resumed operation for the 2010 season. It is sanctioned by IndyCar,[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.eformulacarnews.com/news_info.php?n=6291&sid=981999be5377ca5a46ce6165b276c73d | title = Series Confirmed for 2010 | publisher = Holbi | work = eformulacarnews | date = 2009-10-20 | accessdate = 2009-10-20[/tpl] and is a part of The Mazda Road to Indy.

===List of Formula Ford championships and events===

==Administration==

Ford Motorsport administers some of the national Formula Ford championships around the world, and continue to control the Technical Regulations for all cars globally. The older Kent-engined cars are very popular with club racers, providing the ground for several organizations to run their own series. Many racing schools offer driver training in Formula Ford cars. However, in many countries, Formula BMW and Formula Renault Campus had superseded Formula Ford as the main entry level class in the mid-2000s; the demise of Formula BMW in Europe after only a few years of operation caused somewhat of a resurgence in support for the Ford grids. In the UK there are many club-level regional series aimed at the amateur enthusiast, as well as championships for older Fords.  So popular is the Kent engine around the world that Ford Motorsport recently restarted a limited production of the increasingly hard to source engine blocks: for a major motor manufacturer to restart output of a 40 year old design just shows how well-established the formula still is.

==Related Formulae==

Formula Ford has given birth to several other categories of racing: Formula Ford 2000 evolved in the 1970s to use a Pinto engine and, although it used basically Formula Ford chassis, permitted use of slicks and wings; it was seen as a natural step up from the 1600cc formula and a stepping stone to categories such as Formula Three. Formula Ford 2000 engines and transmissions were married to sports-racing chassis to produce Sports 2000.
Older Formula Fords, with outboard shock absorbers, race in the United States as Club Formula Fords in SCCA and other club racing series.
Formula 100 was an unsuccessful attempt in the late 1960s to create a sportscar category related to Formula Ford but using a 1300 cc Ford engine; the cars were heavy and slow. The proposed Formula Turbo Ford, an attempt to update FF2000, of the mid-1980s was limited to one Reynard that ran a few demonstration laps.
Formula Ford remains popular in its 1600 cc form—the cars are widely raced, sprinted and hillclimbed. Formula Continental is also a popular choice in the USA and Canada. The class provides a venue for Formula Ford 2000 as well as the earlier Formula C (1100 cc pure racing engine) and Formula Super Vee (production-based VW engines) cars. Formula Continental cars employ aerodynamic effects (front and rear wings).

Švanda the Bagpiper ([tpl]lang-cs|Švanda dudák[/tpl]; also known with the German spelling as Schwanda the Bagpiper), written in 1926, is an opera in two acts (five scenes), with music by Jaromír Weinberger to a Czech libretto by Miloš Kareš, based on the drama Strakonický dudák aneb Hody divých žen (The Bagpiper of Strakonice) by Josef Kajetán Tyl.  Its first performance was in Prague at the Czech National Opera on 27 April 1927. It premiered in German, with the translation by Max Brod, at Breslau on 16 December 1928. Other productions quickly followed:Kushner, David Z., "Jaromir Weinberger (1896-1967): From Bohemia to America" (Autumn 1988).  American Music, 6 (3): pp. 293-313.
At the time, the opera, with its use of Czech folk material, enjoyed considerable success, with translations into 17 languages.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://oq.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/7/2/165 | last=Graeme | first=Roland | title=Schwanda der Dudelsackpfeifer.

==Synopsis==

It has been a week since Švanda and Dorota married.  The robber Babinský takes refuge in their farmhouse, and immediately falls for Dorota.  Babinský quickly convinces Švanda of the tedium of married life, and persuades him to go off on an adventure.  They arrive at the Queen's court, where she is under the power of a wicked Magician.  The Queen had made a deal with the Magician where she consented to the death of the Prince, her betrothed, in exchange for a heart of ice (and thus no human feeling) and a diamond scepter, symbolic of her power.  Švanda plays his bagpipes, which breaks the spell.  The Queen then offers herself to Švanda in marriage.  Švanda accepts, kissing her, but then Dorota appears, which angers the Queen.  The Queen, her heart now again of ice, has Švanda and Dorota imprisoned and Švanda condemned to death.
Babinský helps save Švanda by replacing the executioner's axe with a broom.  Švanda plays his bagpipes again, enchanting the crowd gathered for the execution, and escapes with Dorota.  Dorota herself is now angry at Švanda and questions his fidelity.  Švanda retorts that if he ever kissed the Queen, may he go to Hell.  Forgetting that he did kiss the Queen, Švanda immediately drops through the earth into Hell.  Babinský then tells Dorota that he loves her, but she makes him promise to rescue Švanda.  
In Hell, the Devil asks Švanda to play for him, since he has nothing to do, because no one will play cards with the Devil because he always cheats.  Švanda at first refuses, but then Babinský appears and challenges the Devil to a card game.  By cheating even more than the Devil, Babinský wins the game and rescues Švanda.  (It is at this point that Švanda plays the music that forms the famous Fugue.)  At the end, Švanda and Dorota are reconciled, and Babinský sorrowfully leaves, in search of new adventures.

Bomberman Max 2 is a video game released for the Game Boy Advance on 4 June 2002. The game was preceded by Bomberman Max which was released for the Game Boy Color on May 14, 2000. As with Bomberman Max, there are two versions of Bomberman Max 2: Blue Advance and Red Advance. As in the first, in Blue Advance the playable character is Bomberman and in Red Advance the playable character is Max.

==Story==

Bomberman and Max have been shrunk by the evil Mujoe's Mini-Mini Device. They must take revenge on him and his Hige Hige Gang, and, hopefully, return to their normal size.

==Gameplay==

The gameplay is similar to most Bomberman games, where Bomberman and Max lay down bombs to destroy enemies, blocks, etc. Unlike past Bomberman games, however, there is a lack of the classic multiplayer, instead featuring a more Pokémon-like game. In this game, there are many monsters that Bomberman and Max can acquire and use to their advantage.
Both games are more or less the same, although they both have some extra levels and different charaboms.

[[Delegation (law)]]

CATEGORIES: Contract law, Administrative law

In contract law, delegation (Latin intercessio) is the act of giving another person the responsibility of carrying out the performance agreed to in a contract. Three parties are concerned with this act - the party who had incurred the obligation to perform under the contract is called the delegator; the party who assumes the responsibility of performing this duty is called the delegatee; and the party to whom this performance is owed is called the obligee. The term is also a concept of Administrative Law.

==Contracts==

===Delegable contracts===

A delegation will be null and void if it poses any threat to the commercially reasonable expectations of the obligee. For example, a task requiring specialized skills or based on the unique characteristics of the promisee can not be delegated. If a specific celebrity was hired to make a speech, they could not delegate the task to another person, even if the other person would give the same speech, word for word. However, a delegation of performance that does not pose such a threat will be held to be valid. In such a case, the obligee will be under an affirmative duty to cooperate with the delegatee to the extent necessary for the fulfillment of the delegator's obligations

===Breach of a delegated contract===

If the delegatee fails to perform satisfactorily, the obligee may elect to treat this failure as a breach of the original contract by the delegator or may assert himself as a third party beneficiary of the contract between the delegator and the delegatee, and can claim all remedies due to a third party beneficiary.
If the delegation is without consideration, the delegator remains liable for nonperformance, while the delegatee will not be liable to anyone for anything. Unlike an assignment, a delegation is virtually always for consideration, and never donative - few people are going to accept the charitable offer to perform a task contracted to someone else.

===Compare: assignment===

A parallel concept to delegation is assignment, which occurs when one party transfers his present rights to receive the benefits accruing to the assignor under that contract. A delegation and an assignment can be accomplished at the same time, although the right to sue for nonpayment always stays with delegator. Under the common law, a contract clause prohibiting assignment also prohibits delegation. Another common law rule requires that a party to a contract can not delegate performance that involves special skills or reputation (although it is possible to have a novation under such circumstances).

The Chinese People's Party  ([tpl]zh|c=中國民眾黨|p=Zhōngguó Mínzhòng Dǎng[/tpl]) is a small political party in the Republic of China on Taiwan that won three seats in the National Assembly election of 2005. It combines the Blue and Green platforms, upholding the Three Principles of the People while simultaneously aiming for Chinese unification. It operates on the principle "滅共復國" (Exterminate the Communists, Re-seize the Mainland) and its main electoral platform is to launch a large-scale military assault on Mainland China to reclaim it for the Republic of China.http://baike.baidu.com/view/996427.htm
The Chinese People's Party's President is Jeremy Lee, elected on 19th March 2013. He is concurrently the head of the New Revolutionary Alliance (新同盟會), which traces its party lineage to the anti-Japanese Tongmenghui found by Sun Yat-sen in 1905. Jeremy Lee caused international controversy recently by unfurling a Flag of the Republic of China in Canton, Kwangtung; and loudly proclaiming the rule of the Chinese Communist Party illegitimate. The photo has gone viral online, with netizens strongly supporting Jeremy Lee's firm stance for the reunification of China under the Republic of China banner. 
The Chinese People's Party has announced that they will hold a 2013 Penang Conference to discuss the next step forward in their goal to overthrow Communist Rule. The meeting will take place at the historical site of the 1910 Penang conference where Sun Yat-sen kickstarted the first steps towards overthrowing the Qing Dynasty.

[[Jahbulon]]

CATEGORIES: Freemasonry

Jahbulon (or Jabulon) is a word which was allegedly used historically in some rituals of Royal Arch Masonry, and derivations thereof.
There has been much debate over the origin and meaning of this word.  There is no consensus even among Masonic researchers as to its meaning or legitimacy: one Masonic scholar alleges that the word first appeared in an early 18th-century Royal Arch ritual as the name of an allegorical explorer searching for the ruins of King Solomon's Temple; another Masonic scholar believes it is a descriptive name for God in Hebrew; The most common masonic explanation is that it is a word derived from combining parts of the name of God in different historic languages.
Non-Masonic authors, especially those with an anti-masonic attitude, have alleged that it is a Masonic name for God, and even the name of a unique "Masonic God", despite repeated statements by Freemasonry's officials that "There is no separate Masonic God", nor a separate proper name for a deity in any branch of Freemasonry.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.grandlodge-england.org/masonry/A2L-religion.htm | title = Is Freemasonry a religion? | year = 2002 | accessdate=2007-05-08 | publisher = United Grand Lodge of England [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last = Smart | first = Earnest |date=April 2005 | title = Faith and Freemasonry | journal = Masonic Quarterly Magazine | issue = 13 | url = http://www.mqmagazine.co.uk/issue-13/p-46.php | accessdate = 2007-05-07 [/tpl]  It is this interpretation of a "Masonic God" that has led to debates about and condemnation of Freemasonry by several religious groups.  In England, no ritual containing the name has been in official Masonic use since February 1989.Medway, Gareth J. Lure of the Sinister: The Unnatural History of Satanism, New York University Press, 2001. p. 259. ISBN 0-8147-5645-X

==Usages==

===Masonic===

According to Masonic historian Arturo de Hoyos, the word Jahbulon was first used in the 18th century in early French versions of the Royal Arch degree.  It relates a Masonic allegory in which Jabulon was the name of an explorer living during the time of Solomon who discovered the ruins of an ancient temple.  Within the ruins he found a gold plate upon which the name of God (Jehovah) was engraved.Phoenix Masonry Chapter Three: John Ankerberg and John Weldon, authors of The Secret Teachings of the Masonic Lodge, From Is It True What They Say About Freemasonry? The Methods of Anti-Masons by Arturo de Hoyos and S. Brent Morris
In Duncan's Masonic Ritual and Monitor, published in the mid-19th century, Malcolm Duncan uses the word as a recognition password in his rendition of the Royal Arch degree,"They then balance three times three, bringing the right hand with some violence down upon the left. The right hands are then raised above their heads, and the words, Jah-buh-lun, Jehovah, G-o-d, are given at low breath, each companion pronouncing the syllables or letters alternately" Royal Arch, Or Seventh Degree Duncan's Masonic Ritual and Monitor, by Malcolm C. Duncan, 1866 and in a footnote states that the word is a combination of sacred names."JEHOVAH. Of the varieties of this sacred name in use among the different nations of the earth, three particularly merit the attention of Royal Arch Masons: 1. JAH. This name of God is found in the 68th Psalm, v. 4. 2. BAAL OR BEL. This word signifies a lord, master, or possessor, and hence it was applied by many of the nations of the East to denote the Lord of all things, and the Master of the world. 3. ON. This was the name by which JEHOVAH was worshipped among the Egyptians. I have made these remarks on the three names of God in Chaldaic, Syriac and Egyptian, Baal, Jah, and On, in the expectation that my Royal Arch Companions will readily recognize them in a corrupted form.--Lexicon. From footnote 226:1 in Royal Arch, Or Seventh Degree Duncan's Masonic Ritual and Monitor, by Malcolm C. Duncan, 1866   However, there has been controversy regarding Duncan's ritual. According to Turnbull, Everett and Denslow, Duncan has the candidate swear: "I furthermore promise and swear, that I will support the Constitution of the General Grand Royal Arch Chapter of the United States of America..." whereas the General Grand Chapter at the time styled itself: "General Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons of the United States, a subtle but significant difference.Turnbull, Everett R. & Denslow, Ray V., A History of Royal Arch Masonry, Volume I, p. 413,  1956.  Some Masonic authors state that even if Duncan's ritual is authentic, it is either an outdated exposureAn example of this pre-1871 misunderstanding is seen in Duncan's Masonic Ritual and Monitor (an outdated exposure cited by Rev. Ankerberg and Dr. Weldon some 30 times) which declared the tri-lingual word to be the Grand Omnific Royal Arch Word. Chapter Three: John Ankerberg and John Weldon, Is It True What They Say About Freemasonry? The Methods of Anti-Masons, by Art deHoyos or that it had been superseded by another explanation.With Jah and On,  has been introduced into the Royal Arch system as a representative of the Tetragrammaton, which it and the accompanying words have sometimes ignorantly been made to displace. At the session of the General Grand Chapter of the United States, in 1871, this error was corrected; and while the Tetragrammaton was declared to be the true omnific word, the other three were permitted to be retained as merely explanatory. Entry for Bel, Encyclopedia of Freemasonry and its Kindred Sciences'', by Albert C. Mackey M. D.

===Ordo Templi Orientis===

According to Francis X. King in The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O., the word is used in two rituals of the Ordo Templi Orientis: the Lodge of Perfection, in which the candidate receives the Fourth Degree (which is called Perfect Magician and Companion of the Holy Royal Arch of Enoch); and the Perfect Initiate (or Prince of Jerusalem) degree, which falls between the fourth and fifth degrees. King prints in his book the lyrics of a song that mentions the word "Jahbulon."

===Rastafari===

It has been suggested that the Rastafari word for God, Jah, comes from the term Jahbulon, although the name JAH appears in the King James Version of the Bible, in Psalm 68:4.[ref]"Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him." 
[/ref] The term "Jah" also appears throughout the Psalms in other Bible translations, for instance the Darby translation or Young's Literal translation. William David Spencer, in his 1999 Dread Jesus,Spencer, William D. Dread Jesus. London: SPCK, 1999 ISBN 0-281-05101-1, proposes that Archibald Dunkley and Joseph Nathaniel Hibbert were among the preachers that inspired the Rastafari movement, and that both were members of the "Ancient Mystic Order of Ethiopia", a fraternal order derived from Prince Hall Freemasonry. Spencer believes that several features of the Rastafari movement derive from this lodge, including the name "Jah", from the word Jah-Bul-On.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]

==Examples of interpretations of the word based on its syllables==

According to The Rev. Canon Richard Tydeman, in an address to the Supreme Grand Chapter of England on 13 November 1985, the word is a compound of three Hebrew terms:
According to Walton Hannah,Hannah Darkness Visible, pp. 34-5, (1952) reprint 1998, ISBN 1-901157-70-9 the word is a compound of the names of three gods worshipped in the ancient Middle East.[ref]Each syllable of the 'ineffable name' represents one person of this trinity:

==Criticisms of the word and its uses==

Much of the available material that discusses the word Jahbulon does not address the administrative and jurisdictional distinctions amongst the appendant bodies of Freemasonry.  Royal Arch Masonry is an appendant body to Freemasonry.  In some areas it forms part of the York Rite, and in others it is an independent body.  To be eligible to join one must first be a Master Mason.  The administration of the Royal Arch is entirely separate from the administration of Craft Freemasonry.  Every Masonic organization is sovereign only in its own jurisdiction, and has no authority in any other jurisdiction. This means that there is no standardization whatsoever with regards to words, signs, grips, or any other Masonic "secrets".Freemasons for Dummies, Christopher Hodapp, ISBN 0-7645-9796-5, Hungry Minds Inc, U.S., 2005.

Benzothiazole is an aromatic heterocyclic compound with the chemical formula [tpl]Chem|C|7|H|5|N||S[/tpl]. It is colorless, slightly viscous liquid. Although the parent compound, benzothiazole is not widely used, many of its derivatives are found in commercial products or in nature. A derivative of benzothiazole is the light-emitting component of luciferin, found in fireflies.

==Structure and preparation==

Benzothiazoles consist of a 5-membered 1,3-thiazole ring fused to a benzene ring.  The nine atoms of the bicycle and the attached substituents are coplanar. 
Benzothiazole are prepared by treatment of 2-aminobenzenethiol with acid chlorides:T. E. Gilchrist "Heterocyclic Chemistry" 3rd Edition, Longman, 1992.

==Uses==

This heterocyclic scaffold is readily substituted at the unique methyne centre in the thiazole ring.

[[Special Edna]]

CATEGORIES: The Simpsons (season 14) episodes, 2003 television episodes

"Special Edna" is the seventh episode of the fourteenth season of the American animated television sitcom The Simpsons. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 5, 2003. In the episode, Edna Krabappel begins to lose faith in her relationship with Principal Skinner and becomes depressed. Bart wants to cheer her up and decides to nominate her for the Teacher of the Year Award. Edna and the Simpsons are given a free trip to a theme park in Orlando, Florida, called the EFCOT Center. Skinner decides that he needs to do something to win Edna back, so he follows them there. He tries to sabotage Edna's chances of winning the award, in hopes that she will remain at Springfield Elementary if she does not win the prize money. However, he has a change of heart and proposes to her.

==Plot==

Edna Krabappel tells her students to write a paper on World War I, due in three weeks. After class, Edna and Principal Skinner's apple picking date is canceled when Skinner's mother, Agnes, calls him away. At the Simpson household, Bart is distracted from writing his paper. At the end of the three weeks, he still has not started the assignment. The day before the date of submission, he asks Grampa for help. Grampa's story about his WWI experiences as a four-year-old in the trenches is anything but educational, but Bart writes it down anyway and pads it to ten pages using advertisements. Edna rejects his paper and tells him he will have to do it correctly after school. As Bart finishes the assignment after school, supervised by Edna herself, he observes Skinner cancel a movie date with Edna when Agnes calls. Bart consoles Edna, and she reluctantly accepts his offer to accompany her to the movie, though she is grateful.
Lisa suggests that Bart nominate Edna for the Teacher of the Year award. Bart's nomination is accepted when the organizers realize that Edna actually managed to teach Bart Simpson (who was believed to be an "urban legend") and survive. When Edna is informed of her Teacher of the Year nomination, she thanks Bart at the ensuing press conference, wondering aloud if she will continue teaching if she does win. Skinner is about to congratulate Edna when Agnes calls again. Bart informs his family that, as nominator, he and his family are going to Orlando, Florida. The family is excited, until they learn the awards show is being held at the EFCOT Center theme park. At the EFCOT Center, Marge and Lisa go on a "World of Tomorrow" ride, "what the people in 1965 thought the world would be like in 1987." Homer and Bart go on an electric car ride, sponsored by "the gasoline producers of America", that tells them that electric cars can not go very fast or far, and "people will think you're gay" if you drive one.
At Springfield Elementary, Skinner is despondent at the thought that Edna could leave the school. Groundskeeper Willie lends Skinner his sports car so he can go to Orlando, where he surprises Edna with a kiss under the fireworks display – until they are interrupted by Agnes, whom Skinner brought along, much to Edna's ire. During preparation for the awards ceremony, Skinner is shocked when he hears that the winner receives enough money to be able to retire. He requests Bart to help him sabotage Edna's chances of winning, though he has to resort to blackmail after Bart initially refuses. At the ceremony, presided over by Little Richard, each finalist must ask their nominating student a question. When Bart is asked what Edna would like to teach the world, he pretends to be illiterate, until Skinner guiltily tells the truth, adding Edna should be Teacher of the Year because "If she can teach me to love, she can teach anyone anything." With one of Little Richard's rings, Skinner asks Edna to marry him, and she agrees. Edna loses the award, but looks forward to marrying Skinner.

==Production==

"Special Edna" was written by Dennis Snee and directed by Bob Anderson as part of the fourteenth season of The Simpsons (2002–03). The EFCOT Center that is featured in the episode is a parody of Epcot, a theme park in the Walt Disney World Resort near Orlando. A joke featured in this episode was reminiscent of one used in the season four episode "Kamp Krusty" (1992). This joke begins with Homer and Marge kissing while watching a fireworks display, and Homer says "Marge, we've got all the fireworks we need right here", which could be interpreted as him wanting to have sex with Marge, but he actually pulls away a cloth to reveal a basket of fireworks.[tpl]cite web |last=Lesnick |first=Silas |title=Al Jean on Two Decades with The Simpsons |url=http://www.craveonline.com/tv/interviews/135440-al-jean-on-two-decades-with-the-simpsons |publisher=CraveOnline |accessdate=2012-08-24 |date=2010-08-22[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last=Young |first=Susan |title=Reviewing the new season; 'Simpsons' hits 400th show |newspaper=Oakland Tribune |date=2007-05-19[/tpl] American musician Little Richard guest starred in the episode as himself.[tpl]cite web |last=Valdivia |first=Victor |title=The Simpsons: The Fourteenth Season |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/simpsons14.php |publisher=DVD Verdict |accessdate=2012-08-21 |date=2011-12-22[/tpl]

DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that though "I’ve liked episodes that focus on Krapappel, but on the other hand, her relationship with Skinner has always been a bit of a dud. Those two factors cancel each other out to leave this as an average show, though the mockery of EPCOT scores some points. I think the real EPCOT is pretty fun, actually, but the program delivers some amusing pokes at it." "Special Edna" was named the best episode of the fourteenth season of The Simpsons by IGN writers Robert Canning, Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson, and Brian Zoromski. They commented: "First and foremost, this episode, as the title implies, is a nice spotlight on poor, overworked, underpaid Mrs. Krabappel. Krabappel's relationship with Principal Skinner takes center stage ... But there's a ton more to this episode, including Grampa's story about serving as a four year old in World War I; Milhouse showing up with his uncle to give Bart a ride in a Blackhawk Helicopter; and a trip to a very thinly veiled parody of Disney World's EPCOT Center ... that is filled with spot on parodies like the World of Tomorrow ride, which is a horribly dated 1960s take on the far future of the year 1984."[tpl]cite web |last=Canning |first=Robert |title=The Simpsons: 20 Seasons, 20 Episodes |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/731/731095p2.html |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2011-11-04 |date=2010-01-08[/tpl]

[[Microstrip]]

CATEGORIES: Microwave technology, Electronics, Signal cables

thumb|right|200px|Cross-section of microstrip geometry. Conductor (A) is separated from ground plane (D) by dielectric substrate (C). Upper dielectric (B) is typically air. Microstrip is a type of electrical transmission line which can be fabricated using printed circuit board technology, and is used to convey microwave-frequency signals. It consists of a conducting strip separated from a ground plane by a dielectric layer known as the substrate. Microwave components such as antennas, couplers, filters, power dividers etc. can be formed from microstrip, the entire device existing as the pattern of metallization on the substrate. Microstrip is thus much less expensive than traditional waveguide technology, as well as being far lighter and more compact.  Microstrip was developed by ITT laboratories as a competitor to stripline (first published by Grieg and Engelmann in the December 1952 IRE proceedings[tpl]cite journal|last=Grieg|first=D. D.|coauthors=Engelmann, H. F.|date=Dec 1952|title=Microstrip-A New Transmission Technique for the Klilomegacycle Range|journal=Proceedings of the IRE|volume=40|issue=12|pages=1644–1650|issn=0096-8390|doi=10.1109/JRPROC.1952.274144[/tpl]).
The disadvantages of microstrip compared with waveguide are the generally lower power handling capacity, and higher losses. Also, unlike waveguide, microstrip is not enclosed, and is therefore susceptible to cross-talk and unintentional radiation.
For lowest cost, microstrip devices may be built on an ordinary FR-4 (standard PCB) substrate. However it is often found that the dielectric losses in FR4 are too high at microwave frequencies, and that the dielectric constant is not sufficiently tightly controlled. For these reasons, an alumina substrate is commonly used.
On a smaller scale, microstrip transmission lines are also built into monolithic microwave integrated circuits.
Microstrip lines are also used in high-speed digital PCB designs, where signals need to be routed from one part of the assembly to another with minimal distortion, and avoiding high cross-talk and radiation.
Microstrip is very similar to stripline and coplanar waveguide,[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] and it is possible to integrate all three on the same substrate.

==Inhomogeneity==

The electromagnetic wave carried by a microstrip line exists partly in the dielectric substrate, and partly in the air above it. In general, the dielectric constant of the substrate will be different (and greater) than that of the air, so that the wave is travelling in an inhomogeneous medium. In consequence, the propagation velocity is somewhere between the speed of radio waves in the substrate, and the speed of radio waves in air. This behaviour is commonly described by stating the effective dielectric constant (or effective relative permittivity) of the microstrip; this being the dielectric constant of an equivalent homogeneous medium (i.e., one resulting in the same propagation velocity).
Further consequences of an inhomogeneous medium include:

==Characteristic impedance==

A closed-form approximate expression for the quasi-static characteristic impedance of a microstrip line was developed by Wheeler:H. A. Wheeler, “Transmission-line properties of parallel wide strips by a conformal-mapping approximation”, IEEE Trans. Microwave Theory Tech., vol. MTT-12, pp. 280-289, May 1964.H. A. Wheeler, “Transmission-line properties of parallel strips separated by a dielectric sheet”, IEEE Tran. Microwave Theory Tech., vol. MTT-13, pp. 172-185, Mar. 1965.H. A. Wheeler, “Transmission-line properties of a strip on a dielectric sheet on a plane”, IEEE Tran. Microwave Theory Tech., vol. MTT-25, pp. 631-647, Aug. 1977.
Here Z0 is the impedance of free space, εr is the relative permittivity of substrate, w is the width of the strip, h is the thickness ("height") of substrate, and t is the thickness of the strip metallization.
This formula is asymptotic to an exact solution in three different cases
Curiously, Harold Wheeler disliked both the terms 'microstrip' and 'characteristic impedance', and avoided using them in his papers.

==Bends==

In order to build a complete circuit in microstrip, it is often necessary for the path of a strip to turn through a large angle. An abrupt 90° bend in a microstrip will cause a significant portion of the signal on the strip to be reflected back towards its source, with only part of the signal transmitted on around the bend. One means of effecting a low-reflection bend, is to curve the path of the strip in an arc of radius at least 3 times the strip-width.T.H. Lee, Planar Microwave Engineering; Cambridge University Press, pp. 173-174, 2004. However, a far more common technique, and one which consumes a smaller area of substrate, is to use a mitred bend.
thumb|left|200px|Microstrip 90° mitred bend. The percentage mitre is 100x/d To a first approximation, an abrupt un-mitred bend behaves as a shunt capacitance placed between the ground plane and the bend in the strip. Mitring the bend reduces the area of metallization, and so removes the excess capacitance. The percentage mitre is the cut-away fraction of the diagonal between the inner and outer corners of the un-mitred bend.
The optimum mitre for a wide range of microstrip geometries has been determined experimentally by Douville and James.R. J. P. Douville and D. S. James, Experimental study of symmetric microstrip bends and their compensation; IEEE Trans. Microwave Theory Tech., vol. MTT-26, pp. 175-182, Mar. 1978. They find that a good fit for the optimum percentage mitre is given by
For both the curved and mitred bends, the electrical length is somewhat shorter than the physical path-length of the strip.

[[Coronation Crown of George IV]]

CATEGORIES: Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom, Crowns, George IV of the United Kingdom

The Coronation Crown of George IV was the coronation crown of King George IV of the United Kingdom. [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]  It was used in the coronation in 1821. It has remained unworn since 1823.

==Origins==

As the Prince of Wales and as Prince Regent George had been an extravagant figure, with controversial artistic tastes. When he became king, George planned an innovation in British coronations. Instead of having separate coronation and state crowns, he decided to have one crown with which he would both be crowned and would use on state occasions such as the State Opening of Parliament. [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]  
Alongside a change of crown, he also planned to redesign the crown. [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]  Traditionally English and British crowns were decorated with fleurs-de-lis, symbolising the previous claim of English monarchs that they were also King of France. George decided to abandon the fleurs, and replace them with symbols representing Scotland (the thistle), England (the rose) and Ireland (the shamrock). [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]  Part of his ongoing use of symbols of each of the kingdoms was to see him wearing a kilt in Scotland and to pay the first visit to Ireland of a reigning monarch since kings James II and William III fought for the crown in Ireland in 1690.
However the plan to remove the fleur-de-lis and introduce the thistle, rose and shamrock, was abandoned after objections from the College of Heralds. [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]

==Design==

The crown, as finally made, followed closely the standard shape and design of English and British crowns. It contained four half-arches, each joined to the band with a cross pattee into which diamonds were set. The four half-arches met together at a jewelled monde, on top of which a cross sat. Like the State Crown of George I, but unlike St. Edward's Crown, the four half-arches were pulled upright rather than allowed to curve downwards at the monde. 
The gold and silver crown frame was designed by Philip Liebart of Rundell, Bridge and Rundell. It contained an innovative design that made the frame almost invisible behind the crown's jewels. 12,314 jewels diamonds were set in the crown.

==Usage==

George IV was determined to have his crown made the official crown of England, in preference to St. Edward's Crown. [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]  However two years of pressure on his government failed to ensure that the hired jewels that decorated the crown were bought outright by the state. In 1823 he conceded defeat. [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]  The hired jewels were returned and the crown left an empty shell. It was never again worn by him or by any future monarch. 
After standing empty of jewels for nearly 180 years it has now been rejewelled with diamonds loaned by De Beers. [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]  It is on display in the Tower of London. [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]

G. Wells, Horror film characters, Fictional characters introduced in 1897, Characters in written science fiction

Dr Jack Griffin is a fictional character, also known as The Invisible Man, who appears as the protagonist in H.G. Wells' 1897 science fiction novela The Invisible Man. In the original novel, Griffin is a scientist whose research in optics and experiments into changing the human body's refractive index to that of air results in his becoming invisible. The character has become an iconic character, particularly in horror fiction, and versions of it have appeared throughout various media.

==Character overview==

Griffin was a brilliant research scientist who discovered a formula that made a human being invisible. The formula entails taking opium and another drug, which make his blood clear, then processing him in a radiator engine. It succeeds, but he finds himself unable to reverse the process. Unlike the character in the 1933 film, the Griffin of the novel is possibly a psychopath, even before he makes himself invisible.

==Fictional character biography==

Griffin is a gifted young university medical student with albinism, who studies optical density. He believes he is on the verge of a great scientific discovery, but feels uncomfortable working under his professor. To ensure he gets sole credit for the discovery, he leaves university and moves to a dingy apartment to continue his experiments alone.
To finance his experiments, Griffin robs his own father.  The father commits suicide afterward because the money had not been his own. Working reclusively in his flat, he invents a formula to bend light and reduce the refractive index of physical objects, making them invisible. He intends from the start to perform the process on himself, but is forced to rush his experiments due to persistent intrusion from his landlord, who is suspicious of his activities. He processes himself to hide from his landlord, and sets fire to the building to cover his tracks. He winds up alone, invisibly wandering the streets of London, struggling to survive out in the open, unseen by those around him. To make himself visible again, he steals some clothes from a dingy backstreet theatre shop, including a trenchcoat and hat. He wraps his head in bandages to conceal his invisibility, covering his eyes with large dark goggles. He takes up residence in the Coach and Horses Inn in the village of Iping, so he can reverse his experiment in a quiet environment, but complications arise with locals unnerved by his appearance. As a result, his progress slows and he has insufficient money to satisfy the pub owners. To pay the bill, Griffin burgles the home of Reverend Bunting. The police pursue him, and he reveals his invisibility by throwing off his clothes and escaping.
Now driven insane by his inability to reverse the experiment, Griffin seeks assistance from a tramp named Thomas Marvel. He has Marvel carry money for him, but Marvel runs away with the money. Griffin pursues him to the town of Port Burdock, where he runs into his old schoolmate Dr. Kemp. Griffin attempts to convince Kemp to be his visible partner and help him begin a reign of terror. Kemp, rather than assisting the crazed Invisible Man, alerts Colonel Adye of the Port Burdock police.
Furious, Griffin vows to kill Kemp. Kemp rallies the people of Port Burdock, who find and overcome Griffin. Griffin is killed by navvies. The invisibility wears off in death, and Griffin's corpse becomes visible again.

==1933 Universal Studios version==

In the 1933 film The Invisible Man, Griffin's first name is Jack. (The novel never reveals his first name.) He was played by Claude Rains.
Jack Griffin works for Dr. Cranley, assisting him in food preservation experiments alongside his friend Dr. Arthur Kemp. Griffin is deeply in love with Cranley's daughter, Flora, and the two plan to marry. Griffin is afraid he has nothing to offer her, however, and begins experimenting with an obscure and dangerous drug called monocane, hoping his work will make him rich and famous—and a worthwhile husband for Flora.
Griffin discovers a combination of monocane and other chemicals that makes a person invisible. Too excited by his discovery to think clearly, Griffin leaves Kemp and the Cranleys to complete the experiment in solitude. He injects himself with the formula over the course of a month, and becomes invisible. Only after he is invisible does he realize he doesn't know how to turn himself visible again.
Panicking, Griffin goes to the village of Iping and rents a room in the Lion's Head Inn, where he begins searching for a formula to reverse the invisibility. He makes himself appear visible by wrapping his head in bandages and wearing dark goggles.
Curious locals, maddening side-effects of monocane, and frustration from multiple failed tests drive Griffin insane. After he assaults Jenny Hall and severely injures her husband, Herbert, Griffin sheds his clothing to be invisible, and eludes the police. He seeks help from Kemp, but the monocane has made him so insane that he succumbs to megalomania and plans world domination with 'invisible armies'. He wants and makes Kemp his visible partner and assistant.
Not even a visit from Flora and her father helps ease Griffin's increasing insanity. He vows to kill Kemp after his old friend alerts Inspector Lane to his whereabouts, and despite intensive police protection surrounding Kemp, Griffin eventually makes good on his threats. After killing Kemp, he seeks refuge from the cold in a farmer's barn. The farmer summons police, who set fire to the barn. As Griffin flees the burning barn, the Chief of Detectives, who can see his footprints in the snow, shoots at him, the shot passing through both of his lungs.
Griffin dies from the gunshot wounds in the hospital, apologizing for his crimes, saying, "I meddled in things man must leave alone." The invisibility wears off in death, and Griffin's body becomes visible again. 
The film portrays Griffin more sympathetically than does the novel. The novel's Griffin is callous and cruel from the beginning, and only pursues the experiment for wealth and his ego. The movie shows Griffin as an honorable man who is misguided. His insanity is purely a side-effect of the invisibility drug, and his motivation for the experiment was a misguided desire to do good for science and mankind, born primarily out of his love for his fiancée.

==Other character appearances==

===Mad Monster Party?===

The Invisible Man appears in Mad Monster Party? voiced by Allen Swift impersonating Claude Rains. This depiction of the Invisible Man is shown to wear a fez, some sunglasses, and a house robe. He is among the monsters invited by Baron Boris von Frankenstein to attend his meeting at his castle on the Isle of Evil in the Caribbean Sea.

===Mad Mad Mad Monsters===

The Invisible Man appears in Mad Mad Mad Monsters (a "prequel of sorts" of Mad Monster Party?) voiced again by Allen Swift. He, his invisible wife Nagatha, and the Invisible Boy are invited by Baron Henry von Frankenstein to attend the wedding of Frankenstein's Monster and the Monster's Mate at the Transylvania Astoria Hotel.

===The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen===

In Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill's comic book series, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Hawley Griffin is depicted as a member of the Victorian-era team of agents for which the series is named. Griffin is given the first name "Hawley" in the title (as a reference to Hawley Crippen), and it is explained that the Invisible Man killed at the end of the book was actually a half-wit albino that Griffin made invisible as a guinea pig, allowing him to escape to Rosa Coote's boarding school. He is portrayed as a psychopath and a murderer, as in the novel. He is eventually killed by Mister Hyde, who has actually been able to see him all along, after assaulting Mina Murray, breaking her nose and knocking her unconscious, and betraying his teammates to the Martians, stealing military plans for them so he could rule the World with them, and telling them to disable Nemo's submarine by doing something to the water, which is why the Red Weed is used. Moore commented that it seemed fitting for Griffin to join the Martians as both hailed from novels by H. G. Wells.
In the film version, he is called Rodney Skinner due to copyright issues and is played by Tony Curran. The name change is explained by the fact that Skinner was a thief who stole the invisibility formula from the original Invisible Man (presumably Griffin). The fact that his skin is invisible is also related to his name of "Skinner". Skin samples of him are taken by Dorian Grey for Professor Moriarty, allowing him to duplicate the invisibility process, but Skinner himself remains loyal to the League, infiltrating Moriarty's base and working out how best to destroy it. At the film's conclusion, the plans are lost through a hole in the ice when Moriarty is shot, with Moriarty's own invisible man being shot by Allan Quatermain when threatening Tom Sawyer.

===The Martian War===

Kevin J. Anderson's later book The Martian War reuses the name Hawley Griffin for the Invisible Man.

===Anno Dracula===

Griffin makes a brief cameo in Kim Newman's Anno Dracula (1992). Present during the basement meeting between Beauregard and Doctor Fu Manchu, he is described as a scientist and as "an albino who seemed to fade into the background."

===The Invisible Man (2000 TV series)===

On The Invisible Man television series on Syfy, the character played by Joel Bissonnette was a thief whose brother was a scientist who worked on the development of the invisibility gland. His character's nom de guerre was Swiss German, Arnaud DeFöhn, although he went by the Swiss French name Arnaud De Thiel as a cover, while working on the gland. In attempting to retrieve the gland, he later uses the pseudonym Hawley Griffin (a reference to the League of Extraordinary Gentleman and the original Invisible Man), pretending to be a CIA agent from the South.

===The Nobody===

In Jeff Lemire's The Nobody the Invisible Man is named "John Griffen". John Griffen goes through a similar episode as the Invisible Man's "Griffin" does. Both men hide out in an Inn in a small town, only to be driven out because of fear and curiosity.

===Hotel Transylvania===

In Genndy Tartakovsky's  2012 Sony Pictures animated film Hotel Transylvania, Griffin the Invisible Man (voiced by David Spade) is one of the supporting character monsters who checks in to Hotel Transylvania, and is among the circle of friends to Dracula (the story's protagonist). This version is completely invisible, and his glasses are the only thing that can be seen in the movie. Gags centering on him rely on his invisibility. During a pool party scene, one partygoer pulls Griffin's swim trunks down causing him embarrassment even though he is invisible. In another scene in the sauna when Dracula (Adam Sandler) makes a disparaging remark about people with red curly hair, Griffin takes offense to this. When Dracula inquires as to why this is, Griffin says he has red curly hair.

[[Tight junction]]

CATEGORIES: Cell anatomy

Tight junctions, also known as occluding junctions or zonulae occludentes (singular, zonula occludens), are the closely associated areas of two cells whose membranes join together forming a virtually impermeable barrier to fluid. It is a type of junctional complex present only in vertebrates. The corresponding junctions that occur in invertebrates are septate junctions.

==Structure==

Tight junctions are composed of a branching network of sealing strands, each strand acting independently from the others. Therefore, the efficiency of the junction in preventing ion passage increases exponentially with the number of strands.
Each strand is formed from a row of transmembrane proteins embedded in both plasma membranes, with extracellular domains joining one another directly. Although more proteins are present, the major types are the claudins and the occludins. These associate with different peripheral membrane proteins such as ZO-1 located on the intracellular side of plasma membrane, which anchor the strands to the actin component of the cytoskeleton. Thus, tight junctions join together the cytoskeletons of adjacent cells.

==Functions==

They perform vital functions:[tpl]cite web|last=Department|first=Biology|url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/kabernd/berndcv/lab/epithelialinfoweb/Tight%20Junctions.html|publisher=Davidson College|accessdate=2013-09-20[/tpl] 
In human physiology there are two main types of epithelia using distinct types of barrier mechanism. Dermal structures such as skin form a barrier from many layers of keratinised squamous cells. Internal epithelia on the other hand more often rely on tight junctions for their barrier function. This kind of barrier is mostly formed by only one or two layers of cells. It was long unclear whether tight cell junctions also play any role in the barrier function of the skin and similar external epithelia but recent research suggests that this is indeed the case.

==Classification==

Epithelia are classed as 'tight' or 'leaky' depending on the ability of the tight junctions to prevent water and solute movement:[tpl]cite web|last=Department|first=Biology|title=Tight Junctions and other cellular connections|url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/kabernd/berndcv/lab/epithelialinfoweb/Tight%20Junctions.html|publisher=Davidson College|accessdate=2013-09-20[/tpl]

His most famous organ works are his volumes of neo-Baroque chorale preludes and partitas. Paul Manz long served the church as recitalist, composer, teacher and leader in worship. He was Cantor Emeritus at the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Saint Luke, Chicago, Illinois; as well as Cantor Emeritus of Mount Olive Lutheran Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He was the director of the newly established Paul Manz Institute of Church Music, and was Professor Emeritus of Church Music at Christ Seminary Seminex at the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago.Dr. Paul Manz, well-known musician  (The Lutheran Church--Missouri Synod)http://www.lcms.org/pages/rpage.asp?NavID=15996

==Biography==

Paul Otto Manz was born to Otto and Hulda (Jeske) Manz in Cleveland, Ohio. Trained as an educator at Concordia Teacher's College in River Forest, Illinois (now Concordia University Chicago ) he earned a Master's Degree in Music at Northwestern University.Paul Manz (St. Paul Pioneer Press)
A Fulbright grant enabled him to study with Flor Peeters in Belgium and Helmut Walcha in Germany. The Belgian government invited him to be the official United States representative in ceremonies honoring Flor Peeters on his 80th birthday and his 60th year as titular organist of the Cathedral of Saint Rombout in Mechelen, Belgium. At that time, Flor Peeters referred to his former student as ‘my spiritual son.’
Paul Manz concertized extensively in North America. He appeared at Lincoln Center in New York City, with the National Symphony Orchestra, under conductor Geoffrey Simon, at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at Orchestra Hall and with the Minnesota Orchestra under the direction of Charles Dutoit, Leonard Slatkin, and Henry Charles Smith. In addition, he played recitals in churches and cathedrals here and abroad. He was in great demand for his hymn festivals, which are his legacy as a church musician. He conducted many organ clinics, participated in liturgical seminars and appeared as lecturer and recitalist at the regional and national conventions of the American Guild of Organists.Paul Manz Memorial Eucharist (Gloria Dei Lutheran Church)
The esteem and respect with which Paul Manz is regarded can be seen in the many honors he received. He was twice named one of the “Ten Most Influential Lutherans,” served as National Councilor of the American Guild of Organists and is listed as one of the “101 Most Notable Organists of the 20th Century.”Organist Manz was the dean of church music (Star Tribune) He was the recipient of many honorary doctorates and awards. Northwestern University, his alma mater, presented him with the prestigious “Alumni Merit Award;.” The Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago presented him with the distinguished "Confessor of Christ Award"; The Chicago Bible Society presented him with the “Gutenberg Award; and the Lutheran Institute of Washington, DC honored him with the first “Wittenberg Arts Award.” At a convention of the Association of Lutheran Church Musicians, his colleagues honored him for his work in the church. A large gathering in Minneapolis, Minnesota held a “Paul Manz Celebration: Honoring the Life of a Church Musician” where substantial gifts were given to the Ruth and Paul Manz Scholarship for Church Musicians.Paul O. Manz, Christ Seminary-Seminex Professor Emeritus and artist-in-residence at LSTC (The Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago) http://www.lstc.edu/news/index.php?action=viewNews&id=254
Trinity Seminary of Columbus, Ohio bestowed the “Joseph Sittler Award for Theological Leadership” and among his many honorary doctorates is the Doctor of Sacred Music degree from Valparaiso University, and most recently, the Doctor of Music degree from St. Olaf College, Northfield, Minnesota.
As a performer, Manz was most famous for his celebrated hymn festivals. Instead of playing traditional organ recitals, Manz would generally lead a "festival" of hymns from the organ, in which he introduced each hymn with one of his famously creative organ improvisations based on the hymn tune in question. The congregation would then sing the hymn with his accompaniment. Sometimes he would play an improvisation between each sung stanza, as with his well-known variations on the tune, St. Anne, sung to the Isaac Watts text "Oh God, Our Help in Ages Past" with which he would traditionally end each festival. Many volumes of these improvisations have been written out and published and are played by church organists throughout the world.
From 1957 until 1976, while continuing to serve at Mt. Olive, Dr. Manz was called to Concordia College, St. Paul, as professor and chair of the Division of Fine Arts. He left this position in 1976 to return to full-time parish service at Mt. Olive - now as Cantor.  During his time there Paul developed the Hymn Festival  for which he eventually became known throughout the world. Having heard his first hymn festival in 1945, Paul recast the format, adding the unique approach of bringing a number of hymns together under a theme with appropriate readings interspersed. He also brought back the ancient practice of alternation during the singing of hymns. He started doing this at weekly services at Mt. Olive, eventually exposing a wider audience to it through hymn festivals.
Paul’s idea for the hymn festival began to germinate when he presented annual organ recitals at Mt. Olive: “I would always begin and end with a hymn; many people would come to those recitals, and I  found that they thoroughly enjoyed singing the hymns. So finally, instead of doing a recital with a hymn at the beginning and the end, I did a program with hymns only. It caught on like wildfire, and I have subsequently presented hymn festivals all over the world.”

CATEGORIES: 1979 films, 1970s adventure films, American adventure films, American romantic drama films, Neo-Western films, Chase films, English-language films, Films about horses, Films directed by Sydney Pollack, Films set in the Las Vegas Valley, Films shot in Nevada, Films shot in Utah, Columbia Pictures films, Universal Pictures films

The Electric Horseman is a 1979 adventure-romance film starring Robert Redford and Jane Fonda and directed by Sydney Pollack. The film is about a former rodeo champion who is hired by a cereal company to become its spokesperson, and then runs away on a $12 million electric-lit horse and costume he is given to promote it in Las Vegas.

==Plot==

Norman "Sonny" Steele is a former championship rodeo rider who has sold out to a business conglomerate and is now reduced to making public appearances to sell a brand of breakfast cereal. Prior to making a Las Vegas promotional appearance to ride the $12 million champion thoroughbred race horse who responds to the name of Rising Star, Sonny discovers to his horror that the horse has been drugged and is injured.
Identifying with the plight of the horse and disillusioned with the present state of his life, Sonny decides to abscond with Rising Star and travel cross-country in order to release him in a remote canyon where herds of wild horses roam. Hallie Martin, a television reporter eager to be the first to break the Rising Star story, locates Sonny and follows him on his unusual quest through the countryside. While en route, the unlikely pair have a romance as they avoid the pursuing authorities.

==Cast==

==Production==

===Development===

Casting for The Electric Horseman either continued or led to many reoccurring collaborations between cast and crew members. On November 28, 1978, Robert Redford was announced to star in the film,[tpl]cite news|title=Redford joins cast|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eBwvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jdsFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5166,6338596&dq=electric+horseman+sydney+pollack+filming&hl=en|accessdate=October 25, 2013|newspaper=The Beaver County Times|date=November 26, 1978|agency=United Press International|page=16[/tpl] becoming the fifth film in which Sydney Pollack directed Redford following This Property Is Condemned (1966), Jeremiah Johnson (1972), The Way We Were (1973) and Three Days of the Condor (1975). This director-actor relationship would continue with two more films: Out of Africa (1985) and Havana (1990). Pollack had also previously directed Fonda in They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969), whereas Redford and Fonda previously teamed on The Chase (1966) and Barefoot in the Park (1967).
The Electric Horseman is noted as being the debut acting performance of long-time country and western singer Willie Nelson, who plays the role of Wendell Hickson. According to Pollack, Nelson improvised most of his dialogue in the film. Pollack would later be executive producer for Nelson's 1980 starring vehicle Honeysuckle Rose. The film was also only the second film performance of character actor Wilford Brimley, who would later team with Redford in The Natural (1984).

===Filming===

[tpl]quote box|quote="For Electric Horseman, I literally ended up writing half of every night before we would shoot.

While filming generally went smoothly, Pollack struggled with revising the script while filming was underway. In addition, there was one particular day in which production was continuously delayed due to traveling thunderstorms that interrupted the 20-second kissing scene between Redford and Fonda. Ultimately, the scene ended up requiring 48 takes that pushed costs to $280,000.[tpl]cite book|last=Schoell|first=William|title=The Sundance Kid: A Biography of Robert Redford|year=2006|publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=1589792971|page=133|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qpK4uqEWTzQC&pg=PA133&lpg=PA133&dq=The+Electric+Horseman+48+takes&source=bl&ots=Qeb25RpZzY&sig=y84CJkk2LyORU0PxilL8Y2wtieE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=o6JqUp60N82tkAeh94CwAQ&ved=0CGEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=The%20Electric%20Horseman%2048%20takes&f=false|coauthors=Lawrence J.

The musical score to The Electric Horseman was composed by Dave Grusin. In addition to co-starring, Willie Nelson contributed significantly to the film's soundtrack as well, singing five songs including "My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys", "Midnight Rider," "Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys," "So You Think You're a Cowboy" and "Hands on the Wheel." Coinciding with the film's release, a soundtrack album was released featuring both Nelson's songs and Grusin's score.[tpl]cite web|title=Willie Nelson / Dave Grusin – The Electric Horseman (Music From The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)|url=http://www.discogs.com/Willie-Nelson-Dave-Grusin-The-Electric-Horseman-Music-From-The-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/release/1644984|work=Discogs|accessdate=October 25, 2013[/tpl]

==Release and reception==

The Electric Horseman was released theatrically in the United States on December 21, 1979. The film was a box office success, becoming the eleventh highest grossing film of 1979 after grossing a domestic total of nearly $62 million. While the film was co-produced by Columbia Pictures and Universal Pictures, and distributed by Columbia domestically and Universal internationally, the US film rights would later revert to Universal.[tpl]cite web |title=Company credits for The Electric Horseman |work=The Internet Movie Database |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079100/companycredits |accessdate=2007-09-15[/tpl] It has since been released on VHS, Laserdisc and DVD by Universal Studios Home Entertainment.

[[Xanthate]]

CATEGORIES: Salts, Functional groups, Organosulfur compounds

Xanthate usually refers to a salt with the formula ROCS2-M+ (R = alkyl; M+ = Na+, K+).IUPAC does not recommend the use of the term xanthate, although it is in current use in the scientific literature: [tpl]cite web |url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/goldbook/X06696.html |title=IUPAC definition[/tpl]  The name xanthates is derived from Greek ξανθός [tpl]IPA-el|ksantʰós|[/tpl], meaning “yellowish, golden”, and indeed most xanthate salts are yellow. These organosulfur compounds are important in two areas, the production of cellophane and related polymers from cellulose and secondly in mining for the extraction of certain ores.Kathrin-Maria Roy "Xanthates" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. [tpl]DOI|10.1002/14356007.a28 423[/tpl]  They are also versatile intermediates in organic synthesis. Xanthates also refer to esters of xanthic acid.  These esters have the structure ROC(=S)SR'.

==Formation and structure==

Xanthate salts are produced by the reaction of an alcohol with sodium or potassium hydroxide and carbon disulfide:This report gives a detailed procedure for the potassium ethyl xanthate: [tpl]OrgSynth|author=Charles C. Price and Gardner W. Stacy|year=1948|title=p-nitrophenyl sulfide|volume=28|pages=82|collvol=3|collvolpages=667|prep=CV3P0667[/tpl] 
The reaction involves the attack of the alkoxide salt.  For example, sodium ethoxide gives sodium ethyl xanthate.  Virtually any alcohol can be used in this reaction. Technical grade xanthate salts are usually of 90–95% purity.  Impurities include alkali-metal sulfide, sulfate, trithiocarbonates, thiosulfate, sulfite, or carbonate as well as residual raw material such as alcohol and alkali hydroxide. These salts are available commercially as powder, granules, flakes, sticks, and solutions are available. China is a major exporter of granules.
Some commercially important xanthate salts include:
The OCS2 core of xanthate salts and esters is characteristically planar.  The central carbon is sp2-hybridized.

==Reactions==

Xanthate salts characteristically decompose in acid:
This reaction is the reverse of the method for the preparation of the xanthate salts.  The intermediate in the decomposition is the xanthic acid, ROC(S)SH, which can be isolated in certain cases.
Xanthate anions also undergo alkylation to give xanthate esters, which are generally stable:[tpl]OrgSynth|author=Fabien Gagosz and Samir Z. Zard|year=1948|title=A Xanthate-Transfer Approach to α-Trifluoromethylamines |volume=84|pages=32|collvol=11|collvolpages=212|prep=V84P0032[/tpl]
The C-O bond in these compounds are susceptible to cleavage by the Barton–McCombie deoxygenation, which provides a means for deoxygenation of alcohols.
Analogous to their S-alkylation, xanthates bind to transition metal cations as bidentate ligands.  The neutral complexes are soluble in organic solvents.F. Galsbøl, C. E. Schäffer, "Tris (O-Ethyl Dithiocarbonato) Complexes of Tripositive Chromium, Indium, and Cobalt" Inorganic Syntheses 1967, Volume 10, pages 42–49.[tpl]DOI|10.1002/9780470132418.ch6[/tpl]
They can be oxidized to the so-called dixanthogens:

==Industrial applications==

Cellulose reacts with carbon disulfide (CS2) in presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to produces sodium cellulose xanthate, which upon neutralization with sulfuric acid (H2SO4) gives viscose rayon or cellophane paper (Sellotape or Scotch Tape).
Xanthate salts are used as flotation agents in mineral processing. They are intermediates in the Chugaev elimination process and are used to control radical polymerisation under the RAFT process, also termed MADIX (macromolecular design via interchange of xanthates).

==Related compounds==

Rarely encountered, thioxanthates arise by the reaction of CS2 with thiolate salts.  For example, sodium ethylthioxanthate has the formula C2H5SCS2Na.  Dithiocarbamates are also related compounds, and are more useful.  They arise from the reaction of the amine with CS2. For example, sodium diethyldithiocarbamate has the formula (C2H5)2NCS2Na.

==Environmental impacts==

Xanthates may be toxic to aquatic biota at concentrations of less than 1 mg/L.[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/j.ecoenv.2008.05.013[/tpl] Water downstream of mining operations can be contaminated.[tpl]cite doi|10.1007/BF02021019[/tpl]

Jayne County (born Wayne Rogers; 1947) is an American performer, musician and actress whose career has spanned several decades. Formerly known as Wayne County, she went on to be rock's first transsexual singer. Though she has never been a commercial success, she has been an influence on a number of musicians including David Bowie, The Ramones, Patti Smith, Pete Burns and Lou Reed.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] Pianist Jools Holland's first studio outing was with County on her single "Fuck Off".
She is known for her outrageous stage antics and her songs "Are You Man Enough To Be A Woman", "Fuck Off", "Stuck On You," and "Night Time".
County was previously an actress at Andy Warhol's The Factory.

==Life and career==

Born Wayne Rogers in 1947, County left her hometown of Dallas, Georgia, in 1968 to move to New York City, where she became a regular at the Stonewall Inn and took part in the historic riots. In 1969, County was asked by  Warhol superstar and playwright Jackie Curtis to appear in her play, Femme Fatale, at the La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club, which also starred Patti Smith.  In her autobiography, County says of Curtis, "She was my biggest influence, the person who really got me started." After a successful run of Femme Fatale, County wrote World - Birth Of A Nation which she also appeared in, bringing her to the attention of Andy Warhol, who cast her in his own theatrical production, Pork.  After a run in New York, the play, with the New York cast, was performed in London. Upon returning to New York, County appeared in another play, Island, by Tony Ingrassia, again with Patti Smith.
In 1972 County formed Queen Elizabeth, one of the pioneering protopunk bands. Despite being signed to MainMan Artistes, David Bowie's management firm, no records were ever produced. The company spent over $200,000 to film the 1974 stage show, "Wayne at the Trucks", the footage of which has never been released. The show featured numerous costume changes and some of County's raunchiest material.  Eight songs from the show were released on the 2006 CD, Wayne County At The Trucks, on Munster Records. The show is claimed by County to have been the inspiration for Bowie's Diamond Dogs tour.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.katrinafox.com/jaynecounty.htm |title= |publisher= |date= |accessdate=[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] In particular, County maintains that the song "Queenage Baby" was a prototype for Bowie's song "Rebel Rebel", a claim which is supported by some rock critics.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.punkglobe.com/waynecountytrucksreview.html |title=Punk Globe Magazine Online |publisher=Punkglobe.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05[/tpl][tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r862715|pure_url=yes[/tpl]
In 1974 she formed "Wayne County and the Backstreet Boys", which recorded three tracks for Max's Kansas City: New York New Wave, a compilation that also featured Suicide, Pere Ubu, Cherry Vanilla and The Fast.  Wayne County and The Backstreet Boys played regularly at CBGB and Max's Kansas City, where County was also a DJ. In 1976, she appeared in the film The Blank Generation, directed by Amos Poe and Ivan Kral. The film, the recording and the shows were the beginnings of what came to be known as punk rock, and helped define the movement.
In 1977, County moved to London, where the English punk scene was just emerging, and formed Wayne County & the Electric Chairs. County released the EP Electric Chairs 1977, plus a single on Illegal Records. This was followed by "Fuck Off", recorded as a single for Safari Records and supported with a European tour.  While in London, County met Derek Jarman, who cast her as "Lounge Lizard" in the seminal punk film, Jubilee, which also starred Adam Ant, Toyah Willcox, Ian Charleson, Little Nell and  Jordan.  County and band are also featured in The Punk Rock Movie, by Don Letts, containing part of a 1977 performance at The Roxy club in London.
Shortly after this, Wayne County and The Electric Chairs recorded their first, self-titled album, as well as an EP, Blatantly Offensive, which contained "Fuck Off" and "Toilet Love."  After touring they recorded Storm The Gates Of Heaven. The next album, released in 1979, was Things Your Mother Never Told You, which featured several songs based on County's experiences in Germany and it was produced by David Cunningham.  After it was released, the band broke up and County, along with guitarist Eliot Michaels, returned to the U.S.  It was at this time that she changed her stage name to "Jayne County" and began publicly identifying as a woman. The final release by County on Safari Records, Rock and Roll Resurrection (In Concert), was under this new name.
In 1983, County returned to New York where she appeared in the theatrical production Les Girls with Holly Woodlawn. Shortly thereafter she returned to London for the premiere of City Of Lost Souls and stayed long enough to record and tour another album, Private Oyster, with Warren Heighway as manager. Her band included members of various UK based rock bands, including Manchester-based guitarists, Stu Clarke and Chris Lynch Rockson, Mark Pearson on bass and Bazz Creece on drums. Following widespread media attention, she returned to the U.S.   
In the 1990s many of the earlier recordings were released, including the early Safari tracks, on a CD called Rock & Roll Cleopatra. She recorded the album Goddess Of Wet Dreams in 1993, followed by Deviation, in 1995. Later that year she appeared in Wigstock: The Movie and released her autobiography, Man Enough To Be A Woman.    
Since that time several new tracks have surfaced on various compilations and through County's official website. Many of these tracks, both live and studio recordings, were collected on the Ratcage Records release So New York, including collaborations with Lisa Jackson and former Electric Chairs guitarist Eliot Michaels. A live show, recorded on County's birthday, was released on the 2002 CD Wash Me In The Blood (Of Rock & Roll)- Live at Squeeze Box by Fang Records, and features a duet on "California Sun" by County and former nemesis "Handsome" Dick Manitoba of The Dictators.

[[National Democratic League]]

CATEGORIES: Defunct political parties in the United Kingdom, Organizations established in 1900, Radicalism (historical)

The National Democratic League was a cross-party political organisation in the United Kingdom, which aimed to unite Liberal Party and former Independent Labour Party (ILP) members in a campaign for basic democratic reforms."The National Democratic League: 'belated and mutilated Chartism'", Logie Barrow and Ian Bullock, Democratic Ideas and the British Labour Movement, 1880-1914, pp.141-145
The League was founded in October 1900 on the initiative of William Thompson, editor of Reynold's News. Concerned by the Conservative Party majority in the 1900 UK general election and the establishment of the Labour Representation Committee (LRC), he called the "Democratic Convention", aiming to bring together liberals and socialists on a basic democratic programme, inspired by Chartism.
The League's programme contained seven proposals: universal adult suffrage, automatic electoral registration, the abolition of multiple voting, for the state to cover election expenses, and to pay MPs, the abolition of the House of Lords, and the introduction of a two-round system of voting.
Although the programme was limited, it did attract the support of some branches of the ILP and Social Democratic Federation.  Their national organisations did not seek to prohibit them from participating, but were strongly critical of the limited focus of the League.
Tom Mann became the league's first Secretary, serving for three years; he was simultaneously employed as its full-time organiser.Frank Bealey and Henry Pelling, Labour and Politics, 1900-1906, p.51   He was succeeded by H. Victor Fisher.Martin Crick, The History of the Social-Democratic Federation, p.304  Thompson served as the President, while David Lloyd George, Robert Smillie, W. C. Steadman and Richard Bell were among its Vice-Presidents.Peter Barberis et al, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, pp.354-355Frank Bealey and Henry Pelling, Labour and Politics, 1900-1906, p.135
Although initial interest soon faded, Mann's work led to a short revival in its fortunes in 1902.  At this time, the League was particularly strong in London; by 1902, it had 31 branches there, with 34 in the remainder of the country.  However, it soon declined everywhere, particularly as the LRC gained strength and became the Labour Party.  Thompson lost interest in the organisation, and Frank Hugh O'Donnell took over the presidency, while the Fabian James E. Dobson became Secretary, and John Ward became Chairman.The Labour Annual 1908  It appears to have dissolved some time after 1911.
